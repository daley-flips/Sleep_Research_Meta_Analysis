Goals:

    find a good schema

define research questions and goals:

      not sure exactly how this works... word count over time is a bit weak but 
      I'll find something else cool
    -answer interesting questions (ex. what is NREM vs REM)?
      what are sleep spindles?    
      how many hours of sleep is reccomended each night?
      ^come up with more questions here
