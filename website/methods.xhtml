                The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) defines spindles as “A train of distinct waves with a frequency of 11–16 Hz 
                (most commonly 12–14 Hz) with a duration of &gt;0.5 second, usually maximal in amplitude using central derivations”

                , these approaches typically use hand-scored spindles as the standard by which performance is measured and parameters are tuned. 
                Therefore, these automated methods ultimately serve to replicate

                I used XSLT to tag paragraphs with a sentiment attribute (positive, negative, or neutral) based on predefined word lists. The transformation evaluates each paragraph’s text for matches with these lists, wrapping the content in a &lt;citation_analysis&gt; element to record the sentiment. This automated process added sentiment metadata to all 967 XML files for further analysis.
