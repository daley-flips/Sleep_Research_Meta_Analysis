          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Disturbed sleep in inflammatory disorders such as allergy and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is common and may be directly or indirectly related to disease processes, but has not been well characterized in these patient groups, especially not with objective methods.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="s2002">
          <title>Aim</title>
          <p>The present study aimed to characterize objective and subjective sleep in patients with allergy or RA using sleep diaries, one-channel EEG and actigraphy. It also aimed to investigate if sleep measures were associated with central immune activation, assessed using translocator protein (TSPO) positron emission tomography, as well as cytokine markers of peripheral inflammation and disease-specific symptoms or general symptoms of sickness.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="s2003">
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>In total, 18 patients with seasonal pollen allergy, 18 patients with RA and 26 healthy controls were included in the study. Allergy patients and matched controls were assessed twice, in and out of pollen season, and RA patients and controls were assessed once. Sleep was recorded for approximately 1 week at each occasion.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="s2004">
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Patients with allergy had increased levels of slow-wave sleep during pollen season. In contrast, patients with RA had less SWS compared to healthy controls, while no differences were observed in sleep duration or subjective sleep quality. Across groups, neither proinflammatory cytokines, grey matter TSPO levels nor general sickness symptoms were associated with objective or subjective measures of sleep. Rhinitis, but not conjunctivitis, was correlated to worse subjective sleep and more slow wave sleep in allergy. Functional status, but not disease activity, predicted lower subjective sleep in RA.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="s2005">
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>This study tentatively indicates that both patients with allergy and RA display sleep alterations but does not support inflammation as an independent predictor of the sleep disturbance across these patient groups.</p>

      <p>The global prevalence of seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis is estimated to be between 10% and 40%<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and the global prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) about 0.25%.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Despite effective symptom-specific treatments for both seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), levels of non-specific sickness symptoms, including depressed mood, anxiety and fatigue, are high.<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3–8</xref> Poor subjective sleep is commonly also reported in both conditions.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9–13</xref> The pathophysiology of both allergy and RA involves systemic inflammation, and inflammatory cytokines can be related to sleep disturbances and fatigue and are involved in regulation of sleep.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In addition to the acute symptoms of allergy and RA, such as rhinitis and pain, it is therefore likely that underlying inflammatory processes can interfere with sleep in these conditions.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> However, sleep disturbances in these inflammatory disorders and their relationship to immunological markers are still poorly characterized.</p>
      <p>We have previously shown that subjective sleep quality was decreased during pollen season in severe seasonal allergy and that patients with allergy had a shorter total sleep time (TST) compared to controls.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Similarly, self-reported sleep quality has by others been reported to be lower in RA,<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and studies with objective measures of sleep showed more sleep fragmentation and more sleep apnea in RA patients compared to healthy controls.<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Disturbed sleep has also been shown to covary with pain in patients with RA,<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and similarly, apnea and nasal congestion in allergy might impair sleep.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p>
      <p>Across a number of different patient and healthy populations, subjective sleep disturbances as well as long and short sleep durations, compared to normal, are associated with higher levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and C-reactive protein.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> These markers of systemic inflammation are also related to sleepiness and fatigue.<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Sleep disturbances have also been shown to occur in response to vaccination,<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> high doses of lipopolysaccharide<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> as well as during acute respiratory infections.<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Specifically, proinflammatory cytokines, eg IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, are implicated in sleep regulation.<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Furthermore, a specific link between these proinflammatory cytokines and slow wave sleep (SWS) is indicated by observations in animals, where TNF-α or IL-1 beta injections enhance non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and plasma levels of TNF-α covary with electroencephalography (EEG) slow-wave activity and sleep propensity.<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Likewise, animal studies suggest that sleep disturbance is associated with increased pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 levels and microglia activation in the brain.<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p>
      <p>Beyond increased levels of type 2 helper (Th2)-associated cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, allergy has been associated with increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF- α,<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> ie, those implicated in sleep regulation. Correspondingly, RA is associated with RA-specific immunological markers, such as the rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies, but also a general proinflammatory response involving IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α.<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> A testable hypothesis is thus that sleep in both allergy and RA is associated with levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and brain markers of neuroinflammation.</p>
      <p>We have previously investigated glial activation as measured with positron emission tomography (PET) and the translocator protein (TSPO) radioligand [<sup>11</sup>C]PBR28 in small samples of patients with allergy<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and RA.<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Here, we aim to specifically characterize the objective and subjective sleep problems in both these patient samples, and to investigate their relationship to TSPO and peripheral inflammatory markers, as well as disease-specific symptoms and general sickness symptoms. Given that RA and allergy patients show similarities in non-specific symptoms and partly overlapping immunological profiles, data from both samples were pooled in order to increase statistical power for the analyses of sleep and inflammation and sickness. Because of the need to study sleep at home in clinical populations over longer time periods, an additional exploratory aim was to test whether an ambulatory one-channel EEG in combination with a sleep diary could be a feasible method to study sleep in patients with inflammatory disease. The following specific research questions were investigated:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Do allergic and RA patients show disturbed subjective and objective sleep compared to controls and are these changes potentiated during pollen season for the allergic patients? Note that this question has been partly investigated in our previous analysis for the allergic sample (6). <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p></list-item><list-item><p>Are higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood and the glial marker translocator protein (TSPO) as measured with PET, across both RA and allergy associated with worse subjective sleep quality and objective measures of sleep (SWS and TST)?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Are measures of subjective sleep quality, SWS and TST associated with more symptoms of disease severity, ie, rhinitis symptoms in allergy and disease activity score (DAS-28) and functional status (measured with the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) in RA? (Analyses of the Health Assessment Questionnaire were added during the review process.) Furthermore, are more general sickness symptoms as measured with the Sickness Questionnaire significantly associated with poorer subjective sleep quality, less SWS and shorter TST?</p></list-item></list></p>

        <title>Overall Study Design</title>
        <p>The present study is part of a project investigating central and peripheral immune alterations as a potential mechanism underlying nonspecific symptoms in seasonal allergy and rheumatoid arthritis. As previously described,<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> 18 patients with seasonal allergy and 13 matched healthy controls were investigated in and out of pollen season in a counter-balanced design. Similarly, 18 patients with RA and 19 matched controls were investigated once in an otherwise identical design.<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Six of the controls were used as controls for both allergy patients and RA patients resulting in 26 healthy controls in total. At each occasion, participants recorded their sleep for approximately 7 days (see below) in their homes, followed by two testing days (study visits). On the first testing day, participants filled in questionnaires, provided blood samples and underwent a PET examination. On the second testing day, participants underwent pain testing and a battery of cognitive tasks (reported elsewhere). Some data concerning sleep and its relation to inflammation for the allergic group have been reported in a previous publication,<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> see below for details. In a small number of cases, the testing had to be rescheduled after participants received the sleep equipment, which resulted in more recordings or in some cases a delay between the sleep recordings and PET imaging/blood sampling. The study was performed in accordance with the Helsinki declaration and was approved by The Regional Ethical Review Board of Stockholm (no: 2011/1846-31/1). All participants were informed about the purpose of the study and provided written and oral consent.</p>

        <p>All participants were instructed to refrain from alcohol and hard physical activity and to sleep regularly 2 days before the first study visit (ie, the 2 last days of the sleep recording for most participants). Allergic patients did not use any inhaled, nasal or systemic steroids or leukotriene antagonists 10 days before the 1st study visit and were instructed not to use any antihistamines 5 days before study visits, which coincided with the days when sleep was recorded. No RA patient had any treatment with oral steroids, and RA patients were instructed to avoid non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs 2 days before the first study visit, but no other medication change was allowed for these patients the preceding week (ie, during the time when sleep was recorded). Participants were instructed to avoid travel across more than 2 time zones and shift work (nights) 3 weeks before the study visits.

        <title>Sleep Measures</title>
        <p>As reported in Tamm et al,<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> participants filled out sleep diaries daily<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> and used an ambulatory single frontal EEG electrode (MyZeo, Zeo Inc., Boston MA, USA) to measure sleep duration and sleep stages<xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> in their homes for approximately a week. For a subset (n = 38, due to technical circumstances) of the participants, data from actigraphs (Actiwatch Spectrum, Philips Respironics) were available. Participants were sent the sleep equipment 6 days prior to the first study visit, but recorded sleep for a mean of 6.8 days (range 1–14) for logistic reasons, such as rescheduling of study visits.</p>
        <p>Subjective sleep quality was based on sleep diary data.<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> As described in Tamm et al,<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> an index based on four questions (“Did you have difficulties falling asleep?” (1 = very much to 5 = not at all), “How did you sleep?” (1 = very poorly to 5 = very well), “Did you have a restless sleep?” (1 = very much to 5 = not at all), and “Did you wake up very early without being able to fall asleep?” (1 = very much too early to 5 = no)) was computed. Self-reported bed- and rise times were used to calculate time in bed. Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) was used to measure sleepiness (1 = alert to 9 = very sleepy, great effort keeping awake, fighting sleep) every morning and evening.</p>
        <p>Data from MyZeo were first inspected and then manually exported using Zeo Sleep Viewer (version 0.2.9). As described in Tamm et al,<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> we removed recordings where participants reported that the electrode fell off, and in cases where it was judged obvious that most of the recording was missing. Participants were instructed to use the EEG while in bed, and hence, time in bed (TIB) based on MyZeo is defined as the automatically generated “total duration”. Two criteria were used to remove data with poor recording quality. First, only recordings with less than 5% missing data were used. Secondly, recordings where the TIB based on MyZeo was less than 75% of the TIB estimated from sleep diaries for the specific night, were discarded. Criterion two was applied because the first criterion would not find cases where the electrode fell off completely and not reattached. Of 478 recordings, 169 were excluded based on these criteria. The measures exported were TST, no of awakenings, deep sleep (corresponding to N3/N4 or SWS), light sleep (corresponding to N1 and N2) and REM sleep. Actigraph data were automatically scored and exported through Actiware software (Philips Respironics) and we used the measure of TST.</p>

        <title>Statistical Analyses</title>
        <p>The effects of group (allergy/RA patient vs healthy subjects) and pollen season (for allergy) on sleep duration, sleep stages, awakenings, sleepiness and sleep quality were investigated using mixed effects models, with a random intercept for each subject and a second random intercept for each matched pair (patient and control). These analyses were carried out for allergic patients and matched controls and RA patients and matched controls separately. Significant interactions were followed-up with similar mixed effects models investigating one predictor (group or pollen season) at a time. Controls and outside pollen season (for analyses including allergics) were always considered reference levels in the models. All models are presented as effect estimates in original units, ie, minutes, numbers, points on a rating scale, etc., with 95% CI.</p>
        <p>To investigate associations between cytokines, sickness, PET measures and sleep measures across patient groups, linear mixed effects models were used, across the full sample. The specific predictor was allowed to interact with group (ie, RA, allergy, control) and the data for all patients and controls were fitted in the same model. Disease-specific predictors were investigated in models with only the relevant patient group included, ie, RA patients for DAS-28 and HAQ and allergy patients for rhinitis symptoms.</p>

        <p>Additional analyses of the association between asthma symptoms, measured using the Asthma Control Test and subjective sleep quality showed a significant association for ACT and subjective sleep quality in a model without pollen season.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This exploratory study aimed at investigating objective and subjective sleep disturbances in allergy and RA and their association with markers of inflammation. Although preliminary in nature, the results do not support inflammation as a potential common mechanism for sleep problems across patient groups. Neither peripheral measures of inflammation, ie, proinflammatory cytokines, nor grey matter TSPO levels in the brain, were significantly associated with objective or subjective measures of sleep. Both patient groups, however, differed in sleep compared to controls. In addition to shorter TST (across seasons), more morning sleepiness, lower sleep quality and higher percentage of SWS during pollen season that we reported previously,<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> we here report that allergics also showed a higher absolute amount of deep sleep. RA patients had significantly less SWS than controls, while their subjective sleep quality did not differ significantly. Neither was the degree of general sickness symptoms associated with measures of sleep across groups. Instead, rhinitis symptoms in allergy were correlated to worse subjective sleep quality, but more SWS, and higher HAQ in RA was associated to lower sleep quality. Thus, the results suggest that specific measures of disease severity, such as rhinitis symptoms in allergy and functional status in RA, are better predictors of disturbed sleep than inflammatory markers or a global sickness measure.</p>
      <p>As noted above, inflammation was not associated with measures of sleep. The literature on sleep and inflammation support a role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in sleep regulation.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> In the present study, factors such as large time-dependent and between-subject variation in inflammatory measures in combination with one-shot measurement potentially led to risk for Type II-error and lower sensitivity to detect subtle true effects, if present. Although this study increased power for the investigation of sleep in relation to inflammation through pooling data from two patient groups, this may not have compensated fully for these factors. While SWS was not associated with pro-inflammatory markers, pollen season was associated with both an increase in SWS and an increase in proinflammatory cytokines, potentially in line with animal studies showing that TNF-α or IL-1 beta injections enhance SWS and that plasma levels of TNF alpha covary with SWS.<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> However, these relationships seem to be less stable in humans.<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Furthermore, patients with RA also showed an increase in proinflammatory cytokines, but had <italic>less</italic> SWS, compared to healthy.</p>
      <p>We observed no association for sickness ratings and sleep measures across groups. The sickness questionnaire has been shown to be a sensitive measure of general disease and to be sensitive to inflammatory activation.<xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Here we wanted to test whether the concept of <italic>feeling sick</italic>, ie, diagnosis-independent behavior which is sensitive to inflammation, itself could be a predictor of poor sleep, which was not the case. Rather, specific symptoms of allergy (eg, rhinitis) showed associations with poorer sleep quality, but more SWS, and worse functional status in RA correlated with lower sleep quality. Even though the results do not rule out common mechanistic routes for sleep disturbances in different types of inflammatory diseases, the present findings highlight the importance of an individualized and symptom-based approach when dealing with comorbid sleep problems in a clinical setting.</p>
      <p>A striking difference between RA patients and allergy patients was the discrepancy between objective and subjective sleep measures. RA patients, despite changes in objective sleep quality, ie, less SWS, did not differ in their subjective sleep quality compared to healthy controls, while allergy patients showed a decrease in subjective sleep quality during symptomatic seasons, in parallel with changes in objectively measured SWS. It is also notable that these changes included an increase in SWS, which is considered most important for recovery. These findings bring the question of what constitutes subjective good sleep, and the relation between objective and subjective sleep measures to the fore. One explanation could be that patients with allergy, due to disease activity and symptoms, display a higher homeostatic sleep pressure as reflected in more sleepiness, resulting in more SWS.</p>
      <p>Participants were instructed to avoid antihistamines during the 5 days before the study visit, which approximately coincided with the sleep measurements, but an effect of prior medication use could not be completely ruled out. The observed pattern potentially indicates that subjective sleep is dependent on previous experiences of sleep and expectations. Thus, in line with previous studies showing that RA patients tend to underestimate their sleep problems,<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> RA patients may habituate to a poorer sleep quality and display a response shift, adapting sleep appraisal according to life circumstances.<xref rid="cit0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> Along the same line of reasoning, patients with seasonal allergy and recurring predictable changes in disease activity across the year would not habituate to poor sleep quality. Measures of subjective sleep quality might therefore be considered more sensitive to short time than long-time variations in sleep.</p>
      <p>In the present study, sleep was measured using a one-channel EEG, which has previously been validated against polysomnography.<xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> However, this EEG-device has not been validated in clinical populations. In this patient sample, a substantial number of recordings had to be discarded because of poor quality (36% loss), mainly because of the electrode falling off during the night. This loss of data was to some extent compensated for by the fact that participants could tolerate the measurements well and the possibility to have multiple recordings in participants’ homes without assistance of research personnel. The one-channel EEG showed a high convergence with actigraphy-derived measures of sleep and self-rated sleep length, supporting the reliability of the EEG method and its usefulness in a clinical population.</p>
      <p>The main limitation in the present study is the relatively small sample size. Although power is larger in within-subject designs compared to between-subject designs, it still might not have been sufficient to detect clinically meaningful effects. The use of within-subject changes in allergy patients and matched controls for both patient groups potentially mitigated some of this weakness. In contrast to single measurements of inflammation at the day of each PET examination, sleep was recorded in a mean of 6.8 nights at each occasion, leading to a fairly large accumulated number of total recorded nights. Thus, internal validity is more strongly supported for sleep measurements than for measures of inflammation, which were limited to single measurements, with possibly lower reliability. Furthermore, sleep measurements in the present study took place mainly after medication withdrawal in allergic patients, and further studies need to investigate how treatments, including antihistaminergic medication with a clear effect on sleepiness,<xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> affect sleep patterns in allergy. In all, the findings should be regarded as preliminary and further investigation is warranted.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>This study corroborates earlier findings that both patients with seasonal allergy and RA suffer from sleep alterations in addition to their primary symptomatology. Allergy patients reported decreased sleep quality during pollen season, whereas RA patients had objectively, but not subjectively affected sleep patterns. Daily measurements of disease-specific symptoms in allergy and functional status in RA, rather than single measures of inflammation, measured in blood as well as brain, or general sickness was indicated to be of stronger importance to explain poor sleep.</p>
