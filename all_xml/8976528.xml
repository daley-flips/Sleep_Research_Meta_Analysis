        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>Lower-sodium oxybate (LXB) is an oxybate medication approved to treat cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in patients with narcolepsy 7 years of age and older in the United States. LXB was developed as an alternative to sodium oxybate (SXB), because the incidence of cardiovascular comorbidities is higher in patients with narcolepsy and there is an elevated cardiovascular risk associated with high sodium consumption. LXB has a unique formulation of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium ions, containing 92% less sodium than SXB. Whereas the active oxybate moiety is the same for LXB and SXB, their pharmacokinetic profiles are not bioequivalent; therefore, a phase 3 trial in participants with narcolepsy was conducted for LXB. This review summarizes the background on oxybate as a therapeutic agent and its potential mechanism of action on the gamma-aminobutyric acid type B (GABA<sub>B</sub>) receptor at noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurons, as well as at thalamocortical neurons. The rationale leading to the development of LXB as a lower-sodium alternative to SXB and the key efficacy and safety data supporting its approval for both adult and pediatric patients with narcolepsy are also discussed. LXB was approved in August 2021 in the United States for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia in adults. Potential future developments in the field of oxybate medications may include novel formulations and expanded indications for other diseases.</p>

      <title>Plain Language Summary</title>
      <p>Lower-sodium oxybate (Xywav™) is a medication for people with narcolepsy 7 years of age and older. Xywav treats excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and cataplexy (attacks of muscle weakness triggered by emotion). Xywav was developed as an alternative to the first such medication, sodium oxybate (Xyrem<sup>®</sup>), as patients with narcolepsy have a higher rate of cardiovascular disease, and lowering the amount of sodium they consume could help to reduce their cardiovascular risk. Researchers combined calcium, magnesium, and potassium ions with a small amount of sodium to make Xywav, containing 92% less sodium than Xyrem. Strict controls are in place that have successfully restricted how they are distributed due to the potential for abuse of Xyrem and Xywav.</p>
      <p>Xywav and Xyrem have the same amount of oxybate, which is the part that affects narcolepsy symptoms. How oxybate affects EDS and cataplexy is not well understood, but it may act on a specific receptor (gamma-aminobutyric acid type B [GABA<sub>B</sub>]) present in parts of the brain controlling sleep and wake. Although the body absorbs and processes Xywav slightly differently than Xyrem, both medications bring about improvements in EDS and cataplexy symptoms in narcolepsy. Adverse side effects with Xywav are like those seen in previous studies with Xyrem. Xywav is also approved to treat idiopathic hypersomnia, another sleep disorder, in adults.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Sodium oxybate (SXB), first developed in the 1960s, is a central nervous system depressant recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, European guidelines, and expert statements for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and cataplexy in narcolepsy.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> SXB was first approved to treat cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy in the United States (2002) and in Europe (2006).<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3–6</xref> SXB is currently approved in the United States for the treatment of cataplexy or EDS in patients 7 years of age and older with narcolepsy and in Europe for the treatment of narcolepsy with cataplexy in patients 7 years of age and older.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The initial approvals of SXB for use in adult patients with narcolepsy in the early 2000s were based on a number of short- and long-term clinical trials evaluating its safety and efficacy in improving symptoms of narcolepsy, including EDS, cataplexy, and disrupted nighttime sleep.<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8–12</xref> The mechanism of action for the therapeutic effect of SXB is incompletely understood but is hypothesized to be driven primarily by activity of its active oxybate moiety on neurons with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type B (GABA<sub>B</sub>) receptors in regions controlling sleep-wake homeostasis.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Although illicit use of the active drug oxybate, also known as gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), was reported around the time of its approval, monitoring for instances of abuse through a strictly controlled access program has shown low diversion of prescription SXB.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> GHB is at times used to refer to gamma-hydroxybutyrate (as above), and other times to its sodium salt (sodium gamma-hydroxybutyrate or sodium 4-hydroxybutyrate<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>); SXB is the international nonproprietary name for sodium gamma-hydroxybutyrate.</p>
      <p>Lower-sodium oxybate (LXB; Xywav™; previously known as JZP-258), which preserves the active oxybate moiety, was developed as a lower-sodium alternative to SXB to reduce the cardiovascular risk associated with high sodium intake.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15–18</xref> In line with recent efforts from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to reduce dietary sodium intake in the general population,<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> LXB was designated as clinically superior to SXB in patients with narcolepsy by means of greater safety due to its greatly reduced chronic sodium burden; the FDA expects that
<disp-quote><p>“The differences in the sodium content of the two products at the recommended doses will be clinically meaningful in reducing cardiovascular morbidity in a substantial proportion of patients for whom the drug is indicated.”<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p></disp-quote></p>
      <p>Although the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of LXB is not bioequivalent to SXB, its efficacy and safety are comparable.<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20–22</xref> Similar to SXB, LXB has been approved in the United States for the treatment of cataplexy or EDS in patients 7 years of age and older with narcolepsy.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p>

        <title>Early Studies of Oxybate</title>
        <p>Oxybate (as GHB) is both an endogenous metabolite and a precursor of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA; thus, GHB and GABA may be interconverted by endogenous metabolic processes.<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> GHB was first synthesized in the late 1800s by adding a hydroxyl group on the 4th carbon of butyric acid, whereas the sodium salt of oxybate, SXB (also known as sodium 4-hydroxybutyrate), was developed in the early 1960s.<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> This modification was made following the observation that butyric acid had a sedative effect but was mostly rendered inactive via β-oxidation, limiting its therapeutic potential, and ultimately excreted in urine.<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In their characterization of SXB, Laborit et al noted an inhibitory effect on synaptic firing and muscle responses in rat and cat models as well as a hypnotic effect when SXB was used in patients with psychiatric disorders such as depression and psychosis.<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Following this, SXB (then called GHB) was studied in patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy in the 1970s under the rationale that it could normalize the disrupted nighttime sleep seen in these patients. In this early trial, SXB was found to improve nighttime sleep quality and reduce symptoms of both EDS and cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy.<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> SXB has also been used as a general anesthetic when administered intravenously, but does not produce complete surgical anesthesia when administered alone in adults.<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p>

      <sec id="s0003-s2002">
        <title>Clinical Trials and Approval</title>
        <p>The first approval for SXB was granted in Italy and Austria in 1992 for the treatment of alcohol dependence.<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> SXB has been shown to suppress symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome in humans by mimicking the effects of ethanol within the central nervous system and leading to indirect activation of GABA type A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors, converting oxybate to GABA.

        <p>Although SXB has been approved as a pharmacotherapy after demonstrating clinical efficacy and safety in multiple trials, and is approved in some countries to treat alcohol withdrawal syndrome, there is also potential for illicit use. Although not a common adverse effect of SXB or LXB when taken therapeutically, seizures have been noted in people who misuse GHB, likely via its effect on GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors.<xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> In the United States, illicit GHB is designated a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act; however, FDA-approved products containing SXB are controlled under Schedule III.<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Schedule I includes drugs with no currently accepted medical use and high potential for abuse.<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Schedule III includes drugs with moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence. In the year following SXB’s approval by the FDA, the Xyrem<sup>®</sup> Risk Management Program (RMP) was initiated to control distribution of the drug, thereby minimizing the potential for diversion and promoting safe use.<xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> This program involved the utilization of a highly secure, centralized pharmacy as well as the implementation of both a physician and patient education program to ensure compliance with guidelines for SXB prescription and use, and the collection of post-marketing data around safety and incidences of misuse and abuse for consideration by the FDA.</p>
        <p>A review of post-marketing safety data collected in the 5 years following approval found that, among approximately 26,000 patients prescribed SXB, there were 14 cases of SXB abuse reported worldwide.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Cases of potential abuse included inappropriate daytime use, solicitation of a higher dose, intentional overdose, and providing the drug to others; 10 patients (0.039%) met the <italic toggle="yes">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>, 4th Edition criteria for substance abuse.

        <p>The Xyrem<sup>®</sup> Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program began in 2015, succeeding the prior RMP.

        <p>These data illustrate that the restricted distribution and patient and physician education programs employed to prevent SXB misuse and diversion have been effective, and that the abuse potential for prescribed oxybate medications is low.</p>

        <p>Dopamine is a monoaminergic neurotransmitter that is involved in the regulation of sleep-wake states through its actions in the striatum and ventral tegmental area and is involved in the therapeutic response to many wake-promoting therapeutics.<xref rid="cit0062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> Such agents primarily increase extracellular dopamine levels either by blocking its reuptake (eg, modafinil, methylphenidate) or by enhancing its release from presynaptic terminals (eg, amphetamine).<xref rid="cit0063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="cit0064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref> The ventral tegmental area contains a high concentration of endogenous GHB, indicating that GHB has the potential to modulate the activity of dopamine neurons.<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p>

      <p>In 2019, the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine established 2300 mg/day as the Chronic Disease Risk Reduction (CDRR) intake at which sodium reduction is expected to reduce chronic disease risk within an apparently healthy, adult population; thresholds are as low as 1200 mg/day in children.<xref rid="cit0086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref> At the recommended dosages in adults with narcolepsy (6–9 g/night), SXB contributes 1100–1640 mg to daily sodium intake. For pediatric doses of 1–9 g/night, SXB contributes 182–1640 mg sodium per day.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In consideration of the high sodium content of SXB and the cardiovascular risk in patients with narcolepsy, LXB was developed as an alternative to SXB. As previously noted, LXB contains the same active moiety as SXB, but has a unique composition of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium cations resulting in 92% less sodium (87–131 mg in the dose range of 6–9 g/night).<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> By preserving the active oxybate moiety but reducing the total sodium content, LXB is thought likely to reduce CVD risk for patients with narcolepsy relative to treatment with SXB.<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p>

      <title>Early Development of LXB and Pharmacokinetics Data</title>
      <p>In an effort to reduce the sodium content of oxybate-containing medications, the first patent application for a mixed-cation oxybate formulation was filed by Jazz Pharmaceuticals in 2012 and granted in 2013.<xref rid="cit0087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref> Key considerations in developing a new formulation included reduced sodium across all dosages, cation concentrations well within dietary reference intake guidelines, and the management of cation levels per dose to minimize the potential for adverse effects. It was also deemed important to maintain the concentration of oxybate at the same concentration found in SXB (0.413 g/mL; 3.96 M) and to preserve the same total oxybate salts concentration as in SXB (0.5 g/mL) to simplify dosing and transitioning from SXB. A multiple-cation formulation was therefore pursued in order to avoid exceeding recommended intake levels for any individual cation.</p>
      <p>A set of preclinical studies was therefore carried out to identify the best candidate formulation with which to move forward.<xref rid="cit0087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref> One such preclinical study found that oxybate permeability was similar for individual cations and mixed-cation formulations in vitro and that there was no difference in gastrointestinal motility in mice when comparing SXB with individual-cation oxybates (potassium, calcium, or magnesium oxybate) or with comparing SXB with 2 mixed-cation oxybate formulations. A PK study comparing individual- and mixed-cation formulations in rats found that plasma concentration-time (area under the curve [AUC]) values were greatest for SXB and lowest for magnesium oxybate and mixed-cation formulations. Finally, a bioavailability study in dogs comparing SXB and 2 doses of a mixed-cation oxybate demonstrated bioequivalence between both formulations based on the maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and AUC. Based on these studies, 2 lead mixed-cation candidates containing different formulations of cations were identified for further exploration, JZP-507 and LXB, with 50% and 92% less sodium than SXB, respectively. The amounts of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium in LXB are all within recommended intake levels, even at the highest recommended dose, and are thus unlikely to be associated with adverse effects.<xref rid="cit0087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref></p>
      <p>In Phase 1 PK studies, JZP-507 demonstrated bioequivalence (similar AUC and C<sub>max</sub>) compared with SXB, whereas LXB compared with SXB had a similar AUC but a lower C<sub>max</sub> and delayed time to C<sub>max</sub> (t<sub>max</sub>).<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Since absorption of oxybate is primarily mediated by active transport and dependent on sodium concentration, this delayed absorption is hypothesized to be due to the reduced sodium content in LXB.<xref rid="cit0088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref> Though LXB was not bioequivalent to SXB and thus required a phase 3 clinical trial for regulatory approval, a decision was made to pursue this formulation over JZP-507 given its greater reduction in sodium content.</p>

      <p>In 2017, the first pivotal study of LXB was begun; the clinical trial had a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized withdrawal design and was conducted in adult participants with narcolepsy with cataplexy (15–006; NCT03030599; <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Participants could enter this study taking either SXB alone, SXB plus other anticataplectics, or other anticataplectics alone, or they could be anticataplectic treatment naive. Enrolled participants tapered and eventually stopped anticataplectics during a 12-week open-label optimized treatment and titration period, during which all participants were titrated to their individually optimized dose of LXB with a maximal increase of 1.5 g/night/week (up to a maximum total dose of 9 g/night). The titration rate in the clinical study was the same as is recommended in the labels for LXB and SXB.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Following a 2-week stable-dose period (SDP), participants were randomized 1:1 to either continue LXB treatment or switch to placebo during a 2-week, double-blind, randomized withdrawal period (DBRWP). Participants then completed a 2-week safety follow-up period with optional enrollment into a 24-week open-label extension study.</p>
      <p>LXB demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of both cataplexy and EDS in narcolepsy. Changes in the frequency of cataplexy attacks and cataplexy-free days during open-label LXB treatment in the OLOTTP and SDP depended on the type of treatment at study entry (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Randomization to placebo treatment during the DBRWP (n = 65) was associated with a median increase of 2.35 in the weekly number of cataplexy attacks, whereas the median change was 0.00 in participants (n = 69) randomized to continued LXB treatment. Randomization to placebo treatment during the DBRWP was associated with a median increase of 2.0 in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score from the end of SDP, whereas the median change was 0.0 in participants randomized to continued LXB treatment. Participants randomized to placebo during the DBRWP evidenced worsening on the Patient Global Impression of Change and Clinical Global Impression of Change measures, as well as poorer results on quality of life measures (36-item Short-Form Health Survey Version 2 and EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L visual analog scale) relative to those who continued LXB.<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><fig position="float" id="f0002" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>LXB improved symptoms of cataplexy during a pivotal phase 3 trial in patients with narcolepsy. During open-label treatment with LXB in the OLOTTP and SDP of a phase 3 trial of LXB for patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy, the median number of cataplexy attacks (solid symbols) decreased and the median number of cataplexy-free days (open symbols) increased in participants who were naive to anticataplectic treatment during the OLOTTP. Treatment at study entry (SXB only, SXB + other anticataplectics, other anticataplectics only, and anticataplectic naive) is shown in each panel.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="NSS-14-531-g0003" content-type="print-only" position="float"/><attrib><bold>Abbreviations</bold>: LXB, lower-sodium oxybate; OLOTTP, open-label optimization and titration period; SDP, stable-dose period; SXB, sodium oxybate.</attrib></fig></p>
      <p>LXB’s safety profile in this trial was similar to that previously described for SXB,<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref> though participants transitioning from SXB to LXB had a lower overall incidence of the most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; headache, nausea, and dizziness). In a post hoc analysis, it was reported that the majority of TEAEs with LXB occurred early in the study and were generally of short duration (except for decreased appetite).<xref rid="cit0089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref> This is consistent with findings on the timing of the incidence of TEAEs in clinical trials of SXB in participants with narcolepsy.<xref rid="cit0090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref></p>
      <p>Although there are insufficient data on the developmental risk associated with the use of either LXB or SXB in pregnant women, the prescribing information for both medicines contains a warning that they may cause fetal harm based on data in animals.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Although there was no conclusive evidence of developmental toxicity in rats or rabbits administered SXB during organogenesis, oral administration to rats (during pregnancy and lactation) at clinically relevant doses led to increased stillbirths and lower offspring viability and growth. Further, it is known that GHB is excreted in human milk after oral administration of SXB, but there is a lack of evidence relating to the impact of SXB or LXB on breast milk production in mothers or any associated risk for a breastfed infant.</p>
      <p>The hypothesis that reducing the sodium content in LXB may reduce the CVD risk for patients with narcolepsy has not been confirmed. The pivotal clinical trial of LXB in narcolepsy was designed to establish efficacy and the overall safety profile, but was not designed to assess cardiovascular risk (such as with surrogate endpoints including ambulatory blood pressure monitoring or measures of endothelial functioning<xref rid="cit0081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). Additional research comparing cardiovascular outcomes between patients with narcolepsy taking different oxybate formulations would be of interest; however, such trials would be difficult or impossible to conduct, given that narcolepsy is a rare disease and the studies would require long-term follow-up of large populations. Nonetheless, prior research has demonstrated that CVD risk and cardiovascular risk factors are elevated in patients with narcolepsy compared with controls.<xref rid="cit0078" ref-type="bibr">78–81</xref> Furthermore, the FDA continues to stress the importance of reducing total sodium intake in the general population, given the well-established role of high sodium intake as a cardiovascular risk factor.<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="cit0091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>,<xref rid="cit0092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref> Finally, the FDA has recognized the clinical superiority of LXB as compared with SXB in patients with narcolepsy, specifically because of the greatly reduced chronic sodium burden and expected clinically meaningful reductions in cardiovascular morbidity in a substantial proportion of patients for whom the drug is indicated.<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p>

      <title>Approval of LXB for Pediatric Patients with Narcolepsy</title>
      <p>Together with its approval for adult patients with narcolepsy, LXB was also granted FDA approval for pediatric patients with narcolepsy. The FDA approved LXB for use in this population in the absence of a separate registration trial.<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Instead, pediatric approval was granted based on the established efficacy and safety of SXB in this population, the equivalent efficacy and safety of SXB and LXB in adults, and population PK studies.</p>
      <p>A clinical study of SXB in pediatric patients with narcolepsy<xref rid="cit0093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref> showed that SXB had comparable efficacy in pediatric and adult participants, while clinical studies of LXB<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and SXB<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> demonstrated comparable efficacy across both formulations in adults. It was therefore hypothesized that LXB and SXB were likely to have similar efficacy in pediatric patients. As discussed previously, a PK study of SXB and LXB in healthy adult participants found that LXB had a later t<sub>max</sub>, and a lower C<sub>max</sub>, but a similar AUC compared with SXB.<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The PK properties of SXB also were determined to be similar in both adults and children with narcolepsy based on 2 additional PK studies.<xref rid="cit0094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>,<xref rid="cit0095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref> A population PK model previously developed to support the SXB pediatric regulatory filing was then adapted to include data from LXB<xref rid="cit0095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>; this model identified that weight was the major contributing factor to oxybate PK for both SXB and LXB, and showed that a similar dose-exposure relationship existed for SXB and LXB in both adult and pediatric participants with narcolepsy.</p>
      <p>Based on comparable efficacy of SXB and LXB in adults with narcolepsy, the demonstrated efficacy of SXB in children and adolescents with narcolepsy, and similar modeled adult and pediatric population PK for SXB and LXB, regulatory approval was granted for the use of LXB to treat cataplexy or EDS in pediatric patients (7 years of age and older) with narcolepsy.<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The weight-based dosing recommendations for LXB in pediatric patients are the same as those for SXB, and prescribers may transition their SXB dose gram-for-gram to LXB.</p>

      <title>Guidelines on Oxybate Use in Patients with Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence</title>
      <p>In 2007, SXB was recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) as a standard of care for the treatment of cataplexy, EDS, and disrupted nighttime sleep due to narcolepsy, with an optional recommendation for its use in the treatment of hypnagogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis.<xref rid="cit0096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref> In 2021, an update to these guidelines was published based on literature searches performed in 2017, 2018, and August 2020 that were reviewed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. SXB was given a strong recommendation for its use in narcolepsy in adults, based on the findings that treatment with SXB led to clinically significant improvements in cataplexy, EDS, and overall disease severity.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="cit0097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref> SXB was also given a conditional recommendation for the treatment of pediatric narcolepsy due to its demonstrated clinical improvements in EDS, cataplexy, and disease severity, but the quality of the evidence was downgraded in accordance with the GRADE framework, as fewer than 100 patients were analyzed in the clinical trial of SXB in pediatric participants with narcolepsy. SXB was also given a conditional recommendation for its use in other disorders of central hypersomnolence (idiopathic hypersomnia and hypersomnia secondary to alpha synucleinopathies [Parkinson’s disease]), reflecting its potential for the treatment of EDS outside of narcolepsy.</p>
      <p>A corresponding update to the European guidelines on the management of narcolepsy in adults and children was developed by a task force nominated by the European Academy of Neurology, European Sleep Research Society, and European Narcolepsy Network. Following a systematic literature review performed from July to October 2018, and an updated literature review in July 2020, the task force strongly recommended SXB in adults for the treatment of EDS, cataplexy, and disrupted nighttime sleep, with a weak recommendation for the treatment of sleep paralysis/hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In pediatric patients (&gt;6 years of age), SXB was strongly recommended for the treatment of cataplexy and EDS, and given a weak recommendation for the treatment of disrupted nighttime sleep, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations.</p>
      <p>Though LXB demonstrated comparable efficacy and safety to SXB in its phase 3 trial,<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> as previously discussed, these data were not considered during the development of either set of 2021 guidelines. This was not due to the quality of evaluable evidence; rather, LXB was excluded because the publication of the data on its pivotal trial (in October 2020) came after the final update to the literature searches performed by either task force.</p>

      <title>Perspectives on Future Directions in Oxybate Development and Clinical Use</title>
      <p>Despite a nearly 70-year history of research and clinical use, advancements in the field of oxybate-based medications are ongoing and include both the development of new formulations and the assessment of oxybate for use in patients with other disease states. Based on the current knowledge of oxybate’s mechanism of action and its utility in patients with EDS without hypocretin deficiency (such as NT2 and idiopathic hypersomnia), oxybate can improve sleepiness even without the hypocretin deficiency observed in NT1. As such, oxybate-based medications are therefore likely to be effective for multiple hypersomnolence disorders. SXB was given a conditional recommendation for the treatment of EDS in idiopathic hypersomnia in the 2021 AASM guidelines, and LXB is now approved by the FDA for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia in adults on the basis of a pivotal study.<xref rid="cit0098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref> In the pivotal study in participants with idiopathic hypersomnia (<xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), LXB met the primary efficacy endpoint (change in ESS score from the end of SDP to the end of DBRWP) and key secondary endpoints (score change in the Idiopathic Hypersomnia Severity Scale [a reliable and valid clinical tool for the quantification of idiopathic hypersomnia symptoms and consequences<xref rid="cit0099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>] and Patient Global Impression of Change rating from the end of SDP to the end of DBRWP) and showed a similar safety profile to that in patients with narcolepsy.<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p>
      <p>Though there are no ongoing trials examining the use of LXB in participants with hypersomnolence or muscle-related disorders currently registered with the US National Institutes of Health, active trials for SXB (as of July 2021) include studies examining its use for spasmodic dysphonia and voice tremor, nocturnal memory consolidation in major depressive disorder, and REM sleep behavior disorder.</p>
      <p>Another progression in the field of oxybate is the development of extended-release formulations that seek to overcome the need to dose oxybate twice per night. Two candidates currently in development are Avadel’s FT218, which was examined in the REST-ON pivotal phase 3 study and is currently under FDA review for use in patients with narcolepsy,<xref rid="cit0100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref> and Jazz Pharmaceuticals’ JZP324, which is currently in phase 1 clinical trials. Data from the REST-ON trial showed that once-nightly FT218 improved EDS (as measured by sleep latency on the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test) in patients with NT1 or NT2 and reduced the weekly number of cataplexy attacks (in patients with NT1).<xref rid="cit0101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref> If approved, FT218 may therefore offer an alternative dosing schedule, but is not reported to have a reduction in sodium relative to SXB. In contrast, JZP324 uses a lower-sodium formulation of oxybate and, pending results of clinical studies, could potentially offer once-nightly dosing in conjunction with the hypothesized cardiovascular benefit associated with reduced sodium intake compared with SXB. In addition, a novel analog of oxybate that does not contain sodium or other cations, XWPharma’s XW10172, has also been designed to deliver oxybate in a once-nightly dosing regimen. Recent clinical studies evaluating the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of XW10172 support its progression into further clinical development studies.<xref rid="cit0102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref></p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>In conclusion, LXB, which contains a unique formulation of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium ions, represents a significant advancement in the clinical use of oxybate-based medication for patients with narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia and, potentially, other central disorders of hypersomnolence. Developed as an alternative to SXB in response to a need to reduce sodium intake in an already at-risk patient population, LXB offers similar efficacy and safety to SXB, with 92% less sodium, and can be directly transitioned dose-for-dose in both adult and pediatric patients with narcolepsy. LXB has recently been shown to be efficacious in reducing EDS not only in patients with narcolepsy, but also in those with idiopathic hypersomnia.</p>
