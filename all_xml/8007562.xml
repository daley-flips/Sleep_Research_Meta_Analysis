          <title>Purpose</title>
          <p>Poor sleep quality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a result of oxygen desaturation secondary to compromised lung function. Nitrate supplementation with dietary beetroot juice is known to elevate plasma nitrate and to increase the efficiency of oxygen utilization in non-COPD individuals; whether it is of therapeutic benefit for sleep quality in COPD has not been reported.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="s2002">
          <title>Patients and Methods</title>
          <p>In a counterbalanced within-subjects design involving 15 COPD patients as subjects, the subjects consumed either beetroot juice containing nitrate (BJ; ∼6.2 mmol NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>) or placebo (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> -depleted juice) immediately before a night of polysomnographic monitoring. Nitrate was measured in plasma collected immediately after waking.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="s2003">
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>While BJ consumption had no effect on the amount of time spent in any sleep stages, wake-to-N2 transitions and direct wake-to-rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) transitions, hallmarks of disordered sleep, were less frequent on the BJ night than on the placebo night. In the last two hours of the BJ night, percent time in REMS increased and delta power during deep (N3) non-REMS decreased, relative to the placebo night. Collectively, the reduced frequency of atypical transitions and the normalization of non-REMS/REMS dynamics after BJ are indicative of an improvement of sleep quality. BJ also resulted in sustained elevation of peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), during episodes of wake after sleep onset. Plasma nitrate was elevated nearly tenfold on the morning after BJ relative to placebo.</p>

        <sec id="s2004">
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>BJ has a normalizing effect on disordered sleep in COPD, which may be related to improved oxygen delivery.</p>

      <title>Plain Language Summary</title>
      <p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized by disrupted sleep due to low blood oxygen levels during sleep. Dr. Wisor and colleagues sought to improve sleep in COPD patients by giving them a dietary supplement, beetroot juice. Beetroot juice contains nitrate, a substance that is known to elevate blood oxygen levels and improve oxygen delivery to tissues.  When COPD patients drank beetroot juice at bedtime, their overnight sleep quality improved.  The duration of deep sleep episodes was increased on the night when patients drank beetroot juice at bedtime. The frequency of events indicative of healthy sleep, transitions from sleep of immediate depth to deeper sleep, increased on the night when patients drank beetroot juice at bedtime.  The electroencephalographic brain waves measured as part of the study showed an increase in slow oscillatory activity on the night when patients drank beetroot juice at bedtime, a sign of increased sleep depth. Additionally, the blood oxygenation level increased on the night when patients drank beetroot juice at bedtime, albeit only during periodic intervals of awakening from sleep.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>COPD often requires the use of accessory muscles to overcome inadequate ventilation.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The activity of these voluntary muscles is suppressed during sleep, resulting in insufficient ventilation, increased arterial carbon dioxide, oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) desaturation and disruption of sleep<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3–5</xref> Sleep efficiency (SE, percentage of time spent asleep between lights-off and lights-on), total sleep time (TST) and rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) as percent of time spent asleep are all reduced in COPD patients relative to age-matched controls.<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>
      <p>Nitric oxide (NO) is a pluripotent signaling radical, involved in many diverse physiological processes including vasoregulation, nerve transmission and host defense.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>) administered via oral supplementation serves as a substrate for the systemic generation of NO, which prophylactically supports physiological adaptations to hypoxia, including vasodilation and changes in aerobic respiration rate.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Dietary supplementation with beetroot juice (BJ; a natural source of inorganic nitrate) reduces O<sub>2</sub> consumption during exercise in healthy subjects.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Its effects on the performance of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients in exercise are equivocal.<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8–11</xref> However, reductions in resting blood pressure after BJ consumption by COPD patients<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> indicate potential benefits in the resting state.</p>
      <p>The role of NO in cerebral function is complex and has been described as a double-edged sword since it is involved in normal physiology as well as in pathophysiological processes. All three known NO synthase isoforms can be expressed in the brain. Among many functions NO is involved in learning and memory,<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> cerebral autoregulation<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and neurovascular coupling<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> via modulation of nerve transmission both at the post- and presynaptic levels. Moreover, from studies using NO synthase inhibitors or NO donors it has become evident that NO is implicated in modulation of sleep–wake states.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Contrary, NO generation is highly stimulated during excitatory signaling via the glutamate-NMDA pathway, but the roles of NO in conditions such as brain ischemia and seizures are still not clear<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Only a few studies have investigated the effect of nitrate supplementation on cerebral physiology. It has been shown that dietary nitrate may increase cerebral blood flow<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and some studies show improved cognitive function<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> after supplementation with BJ. In a repeated measured experiment involving 15 COPD patients, we assessed the effect of BJ containing nitrate on nighttime sleep quality and efficiency.</p>

        <title>Subjects</title>
        <p>From September 2016 to June 2017 15 subjects were recruited while attending a four-week, in-patient pulmonary rehabilitation program at the LHL-hospital, Glittre, Norway. Prior to inclusion, a diagnosis of COPD in a stable state was verified by pulmonary function tests, see <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Most had moderate or severe COPD—Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) severity stage II and III—one had mild COPD (GOLD stage I) and three patients had very severe COPD (GOLD stage IV). All used inhaler medication in accordance with the GOLD recommendations. None of the patients used supplementary oxygen, all were former smokers except one who was currently smoking with a carboxyhemoglobin level of 4.3%. All had at least one comorbidity, of which the most common were arthrosis or rheumatic disease (nine patients) and hypertension (five patients), none had confirmed asthma overlap with COPD. Demographic details of the study population are published elsewhere<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and are replicated here in <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Exclusion criteria were COPD exacerbation within the last three weeks, chronic respiratory failure, other diseases significantly affecting upper and lower airway function, a prior diagnosis of OSA, non-sinus cardiac arrhythmias, implanted pacemaker, coronary arterial disease with unstable angina pectoris or myocardial infarction within the last three months, uncontrolled hypertension, history of cerebral infarction, use of nitrate medication. All subjects used prescribed medication, but no respiratory depressant drugs were taken from 48 h prior to first PSG-recording until end of study. Informed consent was obtained from all individual subjects included. All procedures performed were in accordance with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. The study was approved by the regional ethics committee (2016/1360/REK Midt, NTNU/REK midt, Det medisinske fakultet, Postboks 8905, 7491 Trondheim).<table-wrap id="t0002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Time Spent in Wake and Sleep States Across the Entire Six-hour Recording Session.

        <p>Subjects slept three nights semi-unattended in their hospital room, with PSG recorded online via a bedside computer. The first night served as an adaptation night, for acquaintance with the equipment (no recording was done). The second and third nights were block randomized to nitrate intervention or control (placebo). Patients were block randomized according to sex and age. Randomization was performed using a web-based randomization system developed and administered by the Unit of Applied Clinical Research at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology—NTNU in Trondheim, Norway. Randomization was undertaken in a 1:1 ratio. The nurse reported time of lights off. PSG was recorded by Embla A10 (Medcare Flaga, Reykjavik, Iceland) according to the 2007 recommendations from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM),<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> including electroencephalogram (F4-M1, C4-M1, O2-M1), left and right electrooculogram, and electromyogram submentalis monitoring.

Fast Fourier transformation was used to calculate electroencephalographic power for each stage in 1 Hz bands from 1 to 20 Hz. In addition, power in the delta (1–4 Hz), theta (5–8 Hz), alpha (9–12 Hz), and beta (15–35 Hz) ranges was calculated for each stage from each of two EEG derivations (F4:M1, C4:M1).</p>

Therefore, we performed separate comparisons of EEG spectral variables independently within each two-hour interval, and did not incorporate time of night as a repeating variable, to maximize sample size and statistical power.

Lower delta power at the end of the BJ sleep session specifically may be a result of increased rate of slow wave sleep need discharge in the BJ condition.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Beetroot juice normalized objective measures of sleep quality in a cohort of COPD patients. Although BJ was without effects on total time spent in each of the polysomnographically defined sleep states, atypical sequences of events seen in the placebo condition (direct wake-to-REMS transitions, transitions from wake to intermediate depth N2 sleep) were reduced in frequency by BJ. Sleep state sequences common to healthy sleep (NREMS-to-REMS) were increased in frequency by BJ. Changes in sleep that unfold across the night in normal sleep (the decline in N3 slow wave activity, the increase in REMS as a percentage of time), were facilitated by BJ consumption. Collectively, the reduced frequency of wake-to-REMS transitions and the increased frequency of NREMS-to-REMS transitions after BJ are indicative of normalization of the sequencing of events within the sleep cycle.</p>
      <p>In addition, O<sub>2</sub> saturation was elevated by BJ, albeit only in periods of wakefulness after sleep onset. Because hypoxia is reported to elevate EEG power in the delta range during wakefulness,<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25–28</xref> we hypothesized that effect of nitrate on SpO<sub>2</sub> during wake would result in changes in the waking EEG spectra. The suppression of delta power during wakefulness by BJ administration is supportive of the concept that BJ promotes cerebral oxygenation, at least during intervals of wakefulness. These data indicate a potential therapeutic effect for bedtime BJ in the treatment of disordered sleep in COPD.</p>
      <p>The principal challenge to intervention in COPD is to expel carbon dioxide and to deliver sufficient O<sub>2</sub> into the circulation. Increasing accessory muscle tone to increase airflow, a mechanism used by healthy individuals in the face of exertion-induced increases in carbon dioxide production and O<sub>2</sub> demand, is a compensatory strategy that COPD patients employ constitutively during sleep.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Yet the respiratory challenges associated with recumbency and the skeletal muscle relaxation that occurs during sleep compromise accessory muscle function.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The trade-off between the need to sleep and the need to employ accessory muscles is likely to negatively impact sleep quality in COPD: across polysomnographically monitored COPD subjects, the extent to which accessory muscles are activated during sleep is proportional to the severity of disruption of sleep.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Adjunct therapeutic measures that improve the delivery of circulating oxygen or the efficiency of oxygen utilization may be beneficial to sleep in COPD.</p>
      <p>Orally administered nitrate in BJ undergoes conversion to nitrite in the digestive tract, which then undergoes conversion to nitric oxide systemically, resulting in increased efficiency of oxygen delivery and aerobic respiration.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> BJ elevates plasma nitrate acutely in COPD patients when administered during the day.<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> As shown here, when BJ is administered at bedtime, the elevation of plasma nitrate is of sufficient duration to be detected in plasma samples taken the next morning. However, nitrite levels were not significantly higher compared to controls. Since plasma half-life of nitrate is approximately five to six hours but only 20–30 min for nitrite and the last dose of BJ was administered the night before and samples taken the morning after, this may explain the lack of difference in plasma nitrite between the groups. Moreover, we cannot fully exclude some oxidation of nitrite to nitrate during sample handling, which is a known methodological concern when handling these anions.</p>
      <p>Previous observations of sleep fragmentation in COPD<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> provide a target for therapeutic intervention. Although we did not compare the COPD population to a healthy age-matched control group, salient features of sleep pathology were present in the subjects (transitions from wake to N2 and vice versa and direct transitions from wake to REMS). These pathological events were reduced in frequency by consumption of BJ with nitrate as an active component. Wake-to-REMS transitions in untreated COPD may reflect a high REM propensity, as the propensity for REMS accumulates during NREMS.<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> By analogy, sleep onset REM-sleep periods (SOREMPs)<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and NREMS fragmentation<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> are seen in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). In OSA, insufficient O<sub>2</sub> delivery during sleep prevents the normal (typically hour-long) sequence of states from wake to light non-REMS (N1) to deeper non-REMS (N2/N3) to REMS. SOREMPs in OSA are a manifestation of elevated REMS propensity due to the inability to maintain normal state sequencing. The wake-to-REMS transitions in untreated COPD are likely to be analogous in their pathophysiological basis. Protracted NREMS cannot occur due to insufficient O<sub>2</sub> delivery during sleep (possibly exacerbated by increased carbon dioxide); REMS pressure builds during repeatedly aborted wake/deep sleep transitions and is then manifested as wake-to-REMS transitions.</p>
      <p>The dynamics of the NREMS EEG across the night, particularly the decline in EEG delta power in N3 sleep, reflect a discharge of homeostatic sleep need.<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Since per-epoch EEG power was equivalent in the first two-hour intervals of the BJ and placebo nights, but lower in the third two-hour interval of BJ relative to placebo, there may have been a greater discharge of sleep need under the influence of nitrate. Increased time spent in deep sleep, or increased state stability, might explain accelerated discharge. In the sleep of healthy young adults, it is typical for the NREMS states to occur sequentially in proportion to their depth (N1/N2/N3) at sleep onset; transitions from wake to N2 are less frequent than wake to N1.<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Here, wake-to-N2 transitions were more frequent after placebo (a total of 21 observed) than BJ (nine observed).</p>
      <p>Collectively, suppression of slow wave activity in the wake state, and reduced numbers of both aborted wake-to-deep sleep transitions and wake-to-REMS transitions in the BJ condition relative to the placebo led us to hypothesize that O<sub>2</sub> delivery might be improved by BJ, allowing for more stable maintenance of sleep states. The state-specific dynamics of SpO<sub>2</sub> values support this hypothesis only for episodes of WASO. During wake, accessory muscles can most effectively be put to use for O<sub>2</sub> delivery; the loss of this mechanism due to sleep-related atonia may have nullified the effect of BJ.</p>

      <title>Limitations</title>
      <p>The study did not include data from non-COPD control subjects, but the counterbalanced, repeated measures design incorporated a control (placebo) condition to which the therapeutic intervention (BJ) could be compared. While it is clear from previous studies that COPD disrupts sleep,<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> the absence of data from an age-matched healthy control population in the current study prevents us from quantifying the extent to which BJ ameliorates sleep deficits in COPD relative to the general population. No measures of daytime sleepiness or daytime performance on the morning after polysomnography were recorded, so it cannot be ascertained whether daytime functioning was positively impacted by this intervention. Furthermore, given that the O<sub>2</sub> saturation during sleep was not altered by the intervention, it is uncertain whether any health outcomes might benefit in the longer term from this intervention. However, patients underwent a single exposure to BJ at the start of the night.

      <p>Given the lack of change in oxygen saturation during sleep in the BJ condition relative to placebo, it is possible that the polysomnographic effect of BJ is due not to a clinically significant change in oxygen utilization or availability, but rather to a decrease in the awakening response to sleep-dependent hypoventilation after BJ; subjects may have continued to undergo NREMS even in the face of hypoxic conditions after BJ. As a significant percentage of COPD patients show signs of sleep hypoventilation,<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> simultaneous recording of transcutaneous carbon dioxide and/or carboxyhemoglobin should be considered in future studies to address this possibility.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Dietary nitrate supplementation induced polysomnographic changes in patients suffering from COPD: (1) It abolished wake-to-REMS transitions and increased the likelihood of deep NREMS-to-REMS transitions. (2) It increased the amount of time spent in REMS in the latter portion of the night. (3) It precipitated an accelerated discharge of slow wave activity across the night. Collectively, these changes in objective sleep parameters are indicative of improved sleep quality and suggest that BJ can benefit sleep quality, if not tissue oxygenation, in COPD.</p>
