      <abstract>
        <p>Mealtimes and feeding schedules may interfere with the circadian system and impact sleep. The practice of intermittent fasting (IF) in its different formats is increasing worldwide. However, most studies addressing the effect of IF on circadian rhythms, daytime sleepiness, and sleep architecture have been conducted during diurnal IF for Ramadan. In this article, we analyze the effect of diurnal IF on the circadian clock, sleep, and daytime sleepiness. In free-living, unconstrained environments that do not control for lifestyle changes such as sleep/wake schedules, sleep duration, and light exposure, studies have demonstrated sudden and significant delays in bedtime and wake time during diurnal intermittent fasting for Ramadan. However, subsequent studies that accounted for lifestyle factors and sleep/wake patterns have reported no changes in markers of the biological clock, daytime sleepiness, or sleep parameters. Nevertheless, several researchers have demonstrated a reduction in the proportion of rapid eye movement stage sleep as the significant alteration in sleep architecture during fasting.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Fasting, mealtime, and sleep may interact and impact the circadian rhythm of various body organs and cells when food is not consumed at a suitable time relative to the timing of the circadian clock of the body.<xref rid="b1-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Intermittent fasting (IF), in which one voluntarily refrains from food intake for specific times, is an old tradition that is implemented in different practices by various societies around the world.<xref rid="b3-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Several religions practice periods of fasting in their rituals, including Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, and Buddhism.<xref rid="b5-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Recently, IF practice has become popular, and there has been great attention to the physiological and metabolic consequences of IF among researchers.<xref rid="b1-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p>
      <p>IF is different from caloric restriction (CR), in which caloric intake is lowered for long periods by 20%–40% but meal frequency is preserved.<xref rid="b6-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Several types of IF have been described in the literature, including complete fasting every other day,<xref rid="b7-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> significant CR every other day,<xref rid="b8-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> eating only a small amount of calories (500–700) 2 consecutive days/week,<xref rid="b9-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> “time-restricted feeding,” where food intake is restricted to a specified time daily,<xref rid="b10-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> fasting 1 or 2 days per week and allowing 5–6 days ad libitum ingestion of food, and the spiritual diurnal IF practiced during Ramadan, in which there is total abstinence from food and drink during daytime (dawn to dusk).<xref rid="b11-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p>
      <p>Most of the previous studies on experimental IF have assessed its effect on metabolic and cardiovascular risks.<xref rid="b1-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Most studies addressing the impact of IF on sleep and circadian rhythm have been conducted during diurnal IF for Ramadan. Therefore, in this article, we address the impact of diurnal IF on some markers of the circadian clock, sleep parameters, and daytime sleepiness.</p>

      <title>IF for Ramadan</title>
      <p>Diurnal IF for Ramadan is distinct from other forms of experimentally studied fasting for several reasons; therefore, it needs to be treated as a separate entity. Ramadan fasting comprises diurnal IF from dawn to sunset, where participants refrain from eating and drinking during the specified period. Ramadan is a month of the Arabic (<italic>Hijri</italic>) year and hence follows the lunar system. This implies that Ramadan comes during a different season every 9 years, which could affect the duration of daytime and hence fasting duration, where daytime is longer during the summer than in the winter.<xref rid="b13-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p>
      <p>Moreover, diurnal IF is practiced for the full month of Ramadan; this long duration may permit greater adjustment to the fasting protocol than that typically occurs in other forms of experimental IF. Furthermore, several studies have shown that Ramadan is accompanied by lifestyle changes that may influence sleep and circadian rhythms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-nss-10-439">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

      <title>Review method</title>
      <p>The literature search started on the May 1, 2018, with the following keywords: “sleep,” “sleep pattern,” “daytime sleepiness,” “polysomnography,” “sleep architecture,” “circadian rhythm,” “intermittent fasting,” and “Ramadan,” using PubMed (80 results), Clarivate (94 results), and Google Scholar (105 results). In addition, the reference lists of the identified articles were also searched for further references. The following inclusion criteria for human studies were used: children, men, and women were accepted as participants, and both randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized trials were accepted.</p>

      <title>Impact of diurnal IF on the circadian rhythm</title>
      <p>All cells of the human body have circadian clocks, which are generally classified into peripheral and central clocks based on their anatomical place. The central master clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. On the other hand, the peripheral clocks are located in different organs and tissues.<xref rid="b14-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Both central and peripheral clocks act to preserve the circadian rhythm of different tissue physiology via controlling “tissue-specific gene expression.”<xref rid="b14-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p>
      <p>With the aim of ensuring external synchrony between the body and the surrounding environment, besides internal synchrony and correct chronological alignment between the central and peripheral clocks, the timing of the body circadian system must be calibrated repeatedly.<xref rid="b14-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The main entrainment factor (or “Zeitgeber”) for the SCN is light, while peripheral circadian clocks are affected by “neurohumoral modulation.”<xref rid="b15-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Therefore, certain behaviors such as the timing of feeding and the timing of abstinence of food may affect the circadian rhythm.<xref rid="b1-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b12-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b16-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Data that address the impact of IF on the circadian rhythm are limited, and most of those data address the impact of Ramadan diurnal IF on the circadian rhythm. However, current evidence shows that high caloric consumption can lead to alterations in “clock gene expression” in the SCN and other central nuclei.<xref rid="b17-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In addition, animal studies have shown that temporal food restriction and enforced meal times are powerful synchronizers for body clocks in peripheral tissues, while maintaining a fixed light–dark cycle exposure.<xref rid="b19-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Moreover, it has been shown that mealtime schedules can trigger the activation of neural circadian clock genes in several species, which is assumed to be controlled by a “food-entrainable clock.”<xref rid="b2-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b20-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p>
      <p>Almost all physiological systems in the body follow a circadian rhythm, which is reflected by measuring certain hormones and core body temperature.<xref rid="b21-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> During Ramadan diurnal IF, 2–3 meals are taken after sunset: breakfast (a light meal) is taken at sunset, dinner is taken following night prayer in some countries (~1–3 hour after sunset), and a “predawn meal” (Suhur), which means that food consumption, is moved to the hours of darkness. This food intake shift partly inverts the normal circadian pattern of food intake. In theory, this shift in mealtime may disrupt the circadian rhythm and biological clock of fasting participants.<xref rid="b12-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p>
      <sec>
        <title>Subjective assessment of chronotype</title>
        <p>One study assessed chronotypes using an abridged version of the Horne and Ostberg questionnaire in fasting and nonfasting individuals during Ramadan diurnal IF in a “free-living environment” to define three behavioral groups: morning-type, evening-type, and neither-type.<xref rid="b22-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b23-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Interestingly, the study reported an increase in the evening chronotype among the performers of fasting at both the beginning and the end of Ramadan month compared with baseline. Similarly, an increase in evening chronotype was also reported in nonfasting people during Ramadan, which advocates that lifestyle changes other than fasting may influence the circadian rhythm during Ramadan.<xref rid="b23-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> This result strengthens the hypothesis that lifestyle changes accompanying Ramadan may affect circadian rhythms.</p>

        <title>Effects of diurnal IF on body temperature</title>
        <p>Core body temperature increases during the day and decreases at night. Sleep onset is accompanied by a decrease in core body temperature, whereas an increase in core body temperature initiates the wakefulness process.<xref rid="b21-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Studies that assessed changes in core body temperature during Ramadan diurnal IF have reported conflicting results (<xref rid="t1-nss-10-439" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In general, studies that assessed the circadian rhythm during Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting can be divided into two categories: category 1 encompasses studies that examined the changes in some markers of the circadian clock in an unconstrained “free-living environment” without controlling for confounders and lifestyle changes such as meal composition, caloric intake, total sleep time, energy expenditure, or light exposure,<xref rid="b24-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–<xref rid="b27-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and category 2 encompasses studies that controlled for the above confounders.<xref rid="b28-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–<xref rid="b30-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p>
        <p>Twenty-four-hour continuous monitoring of rectal temperature in six healthy volunteers during Ramadan revealed delays in both the “bathyphase” and the “acrophase” of body temperature (ie, the times at which the calculated minimum and maximum values of body temperature occur, respectively).<xref rid="b25-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> One more study reported that the circadian rhythm of body temperature was reversed during Ramadan diurnal IF, with significant decreases in oral temperature at the following times: 09:00, 11:00, 13:00, and 16:00, and considerable increases in temperature at 23:00 and 00:00 hours.<xref rid="b26-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Conversely, a third paper that assessed the oral temperature of volunteers during the first and third weeks of Ramadan at 08:00, 16:00, and 00:00 using a “high-precision” thermometer while controlling for the composition of meals and sleep duration reported no changes in body temperature.<xref rid="b30-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The above studies did not control for most of the lifestyle changes discussed earlier that may impact the circadian rhythm regardless of fasting. To assess the potential effects of lifestyle changes that accompany Ramadan, a well-designed study recruited young adults with “delayed sleep phase disorder” (evening chronotype) who used to sleep during the daytime and wake up and eat at night.<xref rid="b24-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In an unconstrained, free-living environment, the investigators use a portable armband physiological and activity sensor to measure circadian alterations in proximal skin temperature and energy expenditure before Ramadan and during the first 2 weeks of Ramadan.<xref rid="b24-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Interestingly, the study revealed a further delay in the “acrophase” of proximal skin temperature and energy expenditure denoting a shift in the circadian pattern. The findings of this study support the hypothesis that factors other than the sudden shift in mealtimes may influence sleep patterns and circadian rhythms during Ramadan.<xref rid="b24-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>

        <title>Effects of diurnal IF on melatonin and other hormones</title>
        <p>Melatonin is a useful marker of circadian rhythm because it is highly precise and accurate.<xref rid="b26-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b31-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="b32-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Therefore, proper measurement of melatonin level is an excellent method to examine the impact of diurnal IF on the circadian rhythm. One study assessed the blood levels of melatonin every 4 hours (not including the 02:00 time point measurement to avoid sleep disruption) before and at the end of the third week of Ramadan.<xref rid="b27-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The study revealed a reduced, delayed night peak and a flattened slope in serum melatonin concentrations during Ramadan.<xref rid="b27-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Another study, which measured the salivary melatonin levels of eight healthy volunteers (who performed diurnal IF) over a 24 hours period (08:00, 16:00, and 00:00) at three time points – 1 week before Ramadan and at the end of the first and third weeks of Ramadan – while controlling for total sleep time, revealed a statistically significant fall in melatonin concentrations at 00:00 and 16:00 during Ramadan compared to baseline levels.<xref rid="b30-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Although the study reported comparable trends in melatonin circadian pattern during Ramadan and at baseline, the slope was flatter in the former case.<xref rid="b30-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> However, the above studies failed to measure melatonin late at night, neglecting the possibility of a late-night peak in melatonin concentrations.</p>
        <p>None of the above studies accounted for potential confounders that may accompany Ramadan and affect the measured melatonin levels. In a subsequent study, we attempted to overcome those limitations by assessing circadian profiles of serum melatonin during diurnal IF outside Ramadan (to assess the impact of diurnal IF act in the absence of the lifestyle changes associated with Ramadan) and during the second week of Ramadan while controlling for light exposure, sleep pattern, total sleep time, and meal composition.<xref rid="b28-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In eight healthy volunteers, serum melatonin was measured at five time points (22:00, 02:00, 04:00, 06:00, and 11:00) three times: 4 weeks before Ramadan where volunteers were asked to perform diurnal IF (fasting outside the month of Ramadan) for 1 week, 1 week before Ramadan during which volunteers were not fasting and living a routine life, and during the second week of Ramadan while performing diurnal IF. The trough in melatonin levels occurred 11:00 during the three studied periods, which shows that diurnal IF has no significant effect on the circadian rhythm of melatonin when other confounders are accounted for. In addition, a cosinor analysis of melatonin levels showed no significant changes in the “acrophase.”<xref rid="b28-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Therefore, the previously reported changes in melatonin levels during Ramadan could be related to the lifestyle changes that accompany Ramadan. Nonetheless, more studies with larger sample sizes are required to evaluate the effects of diurnal IF on melatonin levels and circadian patterns. <xref rid="t2-nss-10-439" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> summarizes the studies that have objectively addressed changes in the circadian pattern of melatonin during diurnal IF for Ramadan.<xref rid="b27-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b30-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p>
        <p>Most studies assessing melatonin levels during diurnal IF have consistently reported a reduction in measured melatonin levels, even during short-term experimental fasting.<xref rid="b30-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Several theories have been suggested to understand the decrease in melatonin levels during fasting. The nocturnal increase in cortisol levels during Ramadan is a possible mechanism.<xref rid="b33-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="b34-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> In addition, it has been proposed that a decrease in the glucose supply during fasting may result in a decrease in melatonin synthesis,<xref rid="b35-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> as it has been shown in rats that mild hypoglycemia decreases melatonin levels, and administration of glucose improves the decrease in melatonin levels.<xref rid="b36-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> However, previous studies have shown that hypoglycemia does not happen in healthy individuals during diurnal IF.<xref rid="b37-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Reduction in tryptophan had been proposed as a possible mechanism of the reduction in melatonin levels during Ramadan diurnal IF, as tryptophan is essential for melatonin synthesis. Nevertheless, this proposed mechanism is improbable because short duration diurnal IF is not likely to cause a reduction in tryptophan.<xref rid="b36-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p>
        <p>Both leptin and ghrelin hormones are influenced by fasting, mealtime, and sleep. Hence, the abrupt shift in mealtime during diurnal IF for Ramadan may entrain the circadian rhythms of both hormones.</p>
        <p>Two previous studies have examined the impact of diurnal IF on the circadian patterns of leptin using a cosinor analysis. The first study was conducted on free-living participants and revealed a major shift (~5 hours) in the peak and nadir serum leptin concentrations in the third week of Ramadan.<xref rid="b38-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> However, the amplitude and 24 hours mean concentrations of leptin levels revealed no significant changes compared to the levels before Ramadan. Another study reported a significant decrease in plasma leptin concentration at 22:00; however, a cosinor analysis demonstrated no significant changes in the circadian rhythm of leptin.<xref rid="b29-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The sudden change in mealtime during Ramadan may explain the nocturnal decrease in plasma leptin levels. The difference between the findings of the two studies could be explained by the fact that the second study controlled for lifestyle changes and environmental conditions, while the first study did not, which might have resulted in a delay in the circadian rhythm of leptin in the first study.</p>
        <p>So far, only one study has evaluated circadian rhythm of ghrelin during Ramadan diurnal IF while controlling for eating habits and environmental conditions.<xref rid="b29-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> A cosinor analysis revealed no significant changes in the “acrophase” of the circadian rhythm of ghrelin.<xref rid="b29-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p>
        <p>In summary, the above-reviewed studies suggest that during Ramadan diurnal IF, there is a delay in the circadian clock. However, when eating habits and environmental conditions are accounted for, diurnal IF does not significantly affect the circadian rhythm of body temperature and melatonin.</p>

      <title>Effects of diurnal IF on sleep</title>
      <sec>
        <title>Subjective assessment of sleep</title>
        <p>When assessing the influences of diurnal IF during Ramadan on sleep, it is essential to consider the accompanying lifestyle changes during the holy month. For example, in some Muslim countries, the beginning of work is delayed and work duration is shortened during Ramadan. Some of the earlier studies that assessed sleep patterns during Ramadan used sleep diaries and self-reported data. Studies that assessed sleep/wake pattern in three Muslim countries revealed a significant sudden delay in bedtime and wake time during Ramadan in performers of diurnal IF.<xref rid="b21-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b23-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b30-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="b39-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="b40-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p>

        <p>With regard to sleep duration, conflicting results were reported during Ramadan.

          <p>A few studies have objectively measured sleep parameters during the month of Ramadan among volunteers practicing diurnal IF using in-laboratory polysomnography and home-based ambulatory unattended polysomnography.<xref rid="b25-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b30-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="b43-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="b44-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>
<xref rid="t3-nss-10-439" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> summarizes the studies that have evaluated sleep architecture using polysomnography during Ramadan diurnal IF. In studies that controlled for sleep/wake pattern, diurnal IF had no effect on nonrapid eye movement sleep stages, stage shifts, arousal index, or measured cardiorespiratory parameters.<xref rid="b25-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b30-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="b44-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> One study objectively assessed sleep among young athletes and revealed no changes in total sleep time during Ramadan diurnal IF; however, the study reported a significant increase in the number of awakenings.<xref rid="b43-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Nevertheless, a major limitation of the last study is the fact that the study athletes suddenly changed their primary sleep time from night to daytime, and the study did not account for naps. Therefore, the abrupt changes in bedtime and rise time may have accounted for the observed changes in sleep architecture.<xref rid="b17-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b45-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></p>
          <p>A recent study controlled for the lifestyle changes associated with Ramadan, such as sleep/wake pattern, caloric consumption, meal composition, and light exposure to eliminate variables other than meal timing that might affect sleep architecture; it objectively assessed sleep architecture at baseline, during diurnal IF outside Ramadan, during Ramadan, and during a nonfasting period after Ramadan.<xref rid="b44-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep proportion decreased while fasting during and outside Ramadan compared with the baseline; however, the proportion of REM sleep reverted to normal during recovery (after Ramadan).<xref rid="b44-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Three other studies reported a reduction in REM sleep during Ramadan.<xref rid="b25-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b30-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="b43-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> In agreement with the above, studies that assessed the effect of experimental fasting on animals reported similar changes in sleep architecture.<xref rid="b46-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> REM sleep disappeared in piglets following 18 hours of fasting, which reverted to normal after feeding.<xref rid="b46-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></p>
          <p>Several hypotheses have been proposed to account for the decrease in REM sleep during fasting; however, the precise mechanisms are unknown.<xref rid="b12-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In addition, the clinical consequences of reduced REM sleep during fasting are unknown.

        <title>Sleep latency</title>
        <p>With regard to sleep latency during Ramadan IF, studies have reported conflicting results. Roky et al showed a significant increase in sleep latency and a significant reduction in nocturnal sleep time.<xref rid="b25-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> However, in that study, dinner was served 30 minutes before going to bed; the short time between dinner and bedtime could have affected sleep latency. Later studies that provided dinner at an earlier time (3–3.5 hours before bedtime) and controlled daytime naps revealed no change in sleep latency.<xref rid="b13-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b30-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="b44-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></p>
        <p>The above-reviewed studies suggest that when dinner is provided early and daytime naps are controlled for, diurnal IF does not have major influence in sleep architecture. The only change in sleep architecture consistently reported is the reduction in REM sleep.<xref rid="b44-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> However, in a free-living environment that does not control for confounders that usually accompany Ramadan such as mealtimes or the daytime naps, sleep latency and sleep architecture may be disturbed.<xref rid="b43-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></p>

        <title>Subjective assessment</title>
        <p>Studies that used the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score to assess daytime sleepiness reported conflicting results.

        <title>Objective assessment</title>
        <p>In three studies, daytime sleepiness was measured objectively using the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) under controlled conditions.<xref rid="b30-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="b44-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="b51-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> The first study demonstrated an increase in daytime sleepiness at the 10:00 and 12:00 naps in the last week of Ramadan.<xref rid="b51-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> However, the study used an unattended polysomnography recording device, which necessitated the end of the test 20 minutes after the beginning of recording regardless of sleep onset.</p>
        <p>To avert the above shortcomings, a subsequent study used a standard attended MSLT.<xref rid="b30-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> This study measured sleep latency, sleep onset latency, or wake efficiency on the first and third weeks of Ramadan and reported no changes compared with baseline measurements.<xref rid="b30-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Furthermore, spectral analysis of electroencephalography waves during each nap revealed no difference between Ramadan and baseline.<xref rid="b30-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> However, the previous studies did not control for the possibility of sleep deprivation on the nights prior to assessing sleep and daytime sleepiness. A recent study aimed to objectively assess the impact of diurnal IF during Ramadan on daytime sleepiness in eight healthy subjects while providing a fixed sleep–wake schedule, fixed caloric intake, controlled light exposure, and objective monitoring of sleep duration for several nights before the assessment of daytime sleepiness.<xref rid="b44-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> The assessment was performed on four occasions using attended MSLT and the ESS. During the first visit (adaptation night), wrist actigraphy was provided before the start of the study to monitor sleep pattern while at home to ensure that they had a fixed sleep–wake pattern. In subsequent visits, daytime sleepiness was measured using MSLT and ESS in the following order: 21 days before Ramadan after 1 week of diurnal IF “baseline fasting,” 7 days before Ramadan “nonfasting baseline,” on the 24th day of Ramadan, and 14 days after Ramadan “recovery.” The study revealed no changes in the ESS across the four study times. In addition, the MSLT measurements revealed no differences in sleep latency among the “nonfasting baseline,” “baseline fasting,” “Ramadan,” and “recovery” time points.</p>
        <p>Another study assessed the impact of diurnal IF during Ramadan on drowsiness under controlled conditions with a fixed light/dark exposure, caloric intake, sleep/wake schedule and sleep duration via measuring total blink duration (measured using infrared reflectance (IR) oculography) and the mean reaction time (MRT).<xref rid="b61-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> The results of this study showed that diurnal intermittent fasting had no impact on drowsiness or vigilance.<xref rid="b61-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></p>
        <p>CR has been reported to enhance alertness and to upregulate orexin gene expression in animal models.<xref rid="b53-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="b54-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> It has been proposed that mammals, when exposed to a negative energy balance, respond with enhanced alertness to improve their capability to find food.<xref rid="b55-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="b56-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> It has also been shown in animals that orexin (an excitatory neurotransmitter) neurons are important for this adaptive response during fasting.<xref rid="b56-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="b57-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> Moreover, orexin neurons interact closely with the “hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal” (HPA) axis,<xref rid="b58-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> and stimulation of the sympathetic and HPA tone secondary to fasting may further induce arousal through the orexin system.<xref rid="b59-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> Therefore, a recent study assessed the effects of diurnal IF during the month of Ramadan on plasma orexin while controlling for lifestyle changes that may accompany Ramadan, like sleep duration, bedtime and wake time, energy expenditure, light exposure, and food, in eight healthy young men.<xref rid="b60-nss-10-439" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> The results showed that plasma orexin levels increased during the fasting hours.</p>

        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>The impact of diurnal IF on circadian rhythm, sleep, and daytime sleepiness is an exciting topic that deserves future research. Earlier studies have suggested that diurnal IF during Ramadan causes a delay in the circadian rhythm of core body temperature and hormonal secretion. However, more recent studies controlling for lifestyle changes that may influence circadian rhythm showed no effects of diurnal IF on the circadian rhythm.</p>
        <p>In free-living, unconstrained environments that do not control for lifestyle changes, studies have revealed abrupt significant delays in bedtime and rise time. Nevertheless, studies that controlled for environmental conditions and sleep–wake pattern revealed no significant changes in sleep architecture, indicating that the earlier reported changes could be secondary to concomitant lifestyle changes rather than the fasting act per se. The only consistent change in all studies that assessed sleep architecture during diurnal IF is a decrease in the amount of REM sleep.</p>
        <p>Although earlier subjective studies reported an increase in daytime sleepiness during diurnal IF, subsequent studies that controlled for confounding factors reported no changes.</p>
        <p>Larger studies that control for potential confounding factors, such as environmental and cultural conditions (the delay in the start of work and school, light exposure, exercise, and meal composition), are warranted to assess the impact of diurnal IF on circadian rhythms, sleep, and daytime sleepiness.</p>
