          <title>Purpose</title>
          <p>Motivation is an important driver of behaviour, and several frameworks distinguish the willingness of individuals to invest cognitive versus physical effort to achieve a goal. One outstanding question is whether sleep loss lowers motivation within specific domains of effort, or has a global effect on motivation across multiple domains. Here, we investigated the effects of sleep restriction on the motivation to invest cognitive or physical effort in return for reward.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="s2002">
          <title>Materials and Methods</title>
          <p>24 healthy young adults (11 females) completed an effort-based decision-making task over two laboratory sessions – once while sleep restricted (three consecutive nights with a three-hour sleep opportunity), and the other while fully rested (nine-hour sleep opportunity on each night). In an initial reinforcement phase, participants were trained to ceiling performance across six levels of effort on separate cognitively and physically demanding tasks. Then, in the critical decision-making phase, participants revealed their preference for how much cognitive or physical effort they would be willing to invest for reward.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="s2003">
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Sleep restriction reduced the willingness to exert cognitive effort, but spared motivation in the physical domain. Furthermore, the reduction in cognitive motivation appeared to be a primary motivational deficit, which could not be attributed to differences in reward-likelihood of different levels of effort or the temporal structure of the task.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="s2004">
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>The results suggest that sleep restriction has a selective effect on cognitive over physical motivation, which has significant implications for real-world settings in which individuals must maintain high levels of cognitive motivation in the face of chronic sleep loss.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Motivation is fundamental to daily life, and drives us to engage in effortful behaviour in pursuit of our goals – such as the cognitive effort invested by students and academics, and the physical effort invested by athletes and military personnel.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1–4</xref> Chronic sleep loss can have a profound impact on daily function, with particular consequences for professions in which sleep loss is unavoidable (eg, healthcare, the military).<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> It has long been recognised that the effect of sleep loss on performance may be driven, not only by its effects on cognitive and physical capacity,<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7–9</xref> but also through its detrimental effects on motivational drive.<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10–15</xref> Importantly, however, motivation is not a unitary construct, and several frameworks distinguish the motivation of individuals to invest effort in the cognitive vs the physical domains.<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16–18</xref> An important question, therefore, is whether the effects of sleep loss are unique to specific domains of behaviour or generalise across them. However, this topical issue remains to be directly addressed.</p>
      <p>The majority of studies that have examined the consequences of sleep loss on motivation have focused on its impact in the cognitive domain.<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref>,<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Some sleep studies have simply asked the participants to report their willingness to engage in generally cognitively effortful behaviour, eg using a visual analog scale.<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> However, a more sensitive approach developed in the neuroeconomic literature has been to quantify motivation as the willingness of individuals to overcome different levels of effort costs in pursuit of rewards.<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22–27</xref> Such an approach allows us to determine an individual’s aversion to effort by fitting their choices to an “effort discounting” function.<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28–30</xref> In the sleep literature, such effort discounting studies have tended to show that sleep loss seems to reduce the desire of individuals to engage in cognitively effortful behaviour.<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p>
      <p>However, an important unanswered question is the extent to which this reduction in cognitive motivation represents a primary motivational deficit, versus a secondary consequence of sleep loss on other cognitive functions. For example, previous studies have typically found that sleep loss hinders the capacity to complete cognitive tasks, and accentuates time-on-task decrements in task performance.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Furthermore, many previous studies have manipulated effort by systematically varying the amount of time that individuals engage with each level of a task (eg, having to perform the psychomotor vigilance task for increasing periods of time).<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Given that sleep loss hinders the capacity to sustain cognitive performance, previous findings showing reduced willingness to engage in cognitive tasks under sleep restriction, could be, in part, explained by the desire to avoid task failure. Consequently, it is important to confirm that any apparent reduction in cognitive motivation is indeed driven by a greater aversion to effort itself, rather than simply a disinclination to engage in activities that are less likely to be successfully completed.<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p>
      <p>Surprisingly, much less work has examined the link between sleep and physical motivation.<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> These limited data suggest that sleep loss similarly reduces the motivation to invest physical effort. However, these studies are limited in having focused on targeted populations of athletes, in less controlled environments (relying solely on measures of self-reported sleep quality and/or actigraphy), and using less sensitive measures of motivation (eg, a single visual analogue rating score of willingness to perform an effortful task). The impact of sleep loss on physical motivation is therefore unclear. Furthermore, no study has examined the consequence of sleep loss on both cognitive and physical motivation using comparable tasks in the same individuals.</p>
      <p>In this study, we examined the effects of sleep restriction on the motivation to invest cognitive vs physical effort. We tested participants in a controlled laboratory setting over two counterbalanced sessions – once while fully rested, and once while sleep restricted – and required them to make decisions on the amount of cognitive or physical effort that they were willing to exert in return for reward.<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Importantly, our task was designed to control for potential effects of restricted sleep on variables that might influence participants’ choices, including the capacity of individuals to perform each level of effort, and temporal factors.</p>

        <title>Participants</title>
        <p>Data were collected as part of a larger study investigating the effects of sleep restriction on cognition. The final sample comprised 24 healthy adults (see <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), with no history of substance use, neurological or psychiatric disease. Participants were non-smokers, consumed less than 400mg of caffeine per day and reported habitual sleep of between 7 and 9 hours with a bedtime between 22:00 and 1:00 and wake times between 6:00 and 9:00. Additionally, participants had no history of night shift work within the past 12 months. Female participants taking hormonal contraceptives were included in the study. Extreme morning and evening types were excluded from the study based on criteria from the Morning and Eveningness Questionnaire.<xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> This final sample did not include data from two additional participants, from whom data were partially lost due to technical issues. Including the available data from these participants did not alter the main findings. Data was collected between March 2018 and March 2021. Participants were recruited via online advertisements and compensated ~ AUD 2500.<table-wrap position="float" id="t0001"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Participant Characteristics</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2" colspan="1"><bold>Age</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">M= 26.8, SD = 5.2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Range: 21–45</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" colspan="1"><bold>Sex</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">11 Females</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">13 Males</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" colspan="1"><bold>Handedness</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Right-handed: 19</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Left-handed: 5</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>

        <title>Procedure</title>
        <p>Participants completed two testing sessions in a closed laboratory environment. Each participant was admitted to a private, time-isolated, light, and temperature-controlled room. Light was maintained at 100 lux during wake periods and temperature maintained at 21° (± 2°C). Each session lasted four nights (from a Sunday to a Thursday evening), and the sessions were separated by a nine-day interval. For one week prior to each session, participants maintained a regular sleep-wake schedule, based on their self-reported habitual sleep schedule, and verified with actigraphy and sleep diaries.</p>
        <p>In one session (“Fully Rested”), participants were provided a nine-hour sleep opportunity each night. Timing was based on the at-home schedule, with time-in-bed increased equally at the start and end of the night, for those whose at-home schedule included &lt;9 hours in bed. In the alternate session (“Sleep Restricted”), participants were provided a nine-hour sleep opportunity on their first night, but only a three-hour sleep opportunity on subsequent nights, commencing two hours after their “Fully Rested” bed time. Session order was counterbalanced across participants. The first night of the first session served as a sleep disorders screen. On the last day of each session, participants completed the experimental task four to six hours after habitual wake time, typically between 10 am and 2 pm (42 of 46 participants commenced the task between 10.57 am and 12.53 pm). Any given participant was tested at the same time of day in both testing sessions.</p>
        <p>During the in-lab component participants were able to watch movies, play board games, and use a lab provided computer to work. Participants were not permitted to engage in any physical activity more vigorous than walking and there was no access to the internet. Activity was monitored by research staff and actigraphy. Meals and snacks with equivalent macronutrients were provided to participants at regular intervals. Participants were constantly monitored by research staff to ensure adherence to the protocol.</p>

        <title>Effort-Based Decision-Making Task</title>
        <p>We applied a cognitive and physical effort discounting paradigm, details of which have been previously reported.<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> The paradigm consists of two phases. First, participants engaged in a Reinforcement Phase, in which they were trained on: (1) a cognitively effortful task, and (2) a physically effortful task, across separate, counterbalanced blocks. In the subsequent Choice Phase, we examined the willingness of individuals to exert cognitive or physical effort in return for reward. In both tasks, the stimuli were displayed on a 17-inch laptop monitor at a refresh rate of 60Hz positioned ~45cm from the participant. The cognitive effort task was implemented in Presentation software,<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and the physical effort task in the Psychtoolbox package run in MATLAB.<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Participants’ responses were registered with a standard computer keyboard for the cognitive task, and a hand-held dynamometer for the physical task (SS25LA, BIOPAC systems, USA).</p>

          <title>Reinforcement Phase</title>
          <p>The Reinforcement Phase for each task followed the same structure (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B and D</xref>). Each trial began with an effort cue (in the form of a pie chart presented for two seconds) indicating the amount of effort to be invested in that trial. Blue pie charts preceded cognitively effortful trials, and red pie charts physically effortful trials. These cues were followed by a period of effort exertion in the corresponding domain lasting 10 seconds, followed by a feedback display lasting two seconds indicating their success on that trial. For each task, participants completed three repetitions of each effort level delivered in a random order.

          <p>In the critical Choice Phase, we quantified participants’ motivation to exert cognitive or physical effort for a given reward. In each trial, participants chose between a fixed low-effort/low-reward baseline and a variable high-effort/high-reward offer within the same domain. The fixed baseline was the opportunity to perform the lowest level of effort (Level 1) in return for the lowest reward (1 credit). The variable offer was the opportunity to perform higher levels of effort (levels 2–6) for higher rewards (2, 4, 6, 8, 10 credits). The entire Effort x Reward space (5 x 5) was sampled three times in each of the two domains, for a total of 150 trials. Trials were self-paced, participants on average took 5–10 minutes to complete this phase. In keeping with previous studies, we reduced the impact of fatigue accumulation on decision-making by requiring participants to simply indicate their preferred option without executing their choices. In addition, they were explicitly told they should select the option that was most preferable to them, but that the points themselves did not alter remuneration. This protocol is consistent with previous studies and has been shown to be sensitive to changes in motivation.<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38–40</xref></p>

        <p>The outcomes of interest were participants’ performance in the Reinforcement Phase, and their decisions to engage in effortful behaviour in the Choice Phase. In the Reinforcement Phase, we examined the effect of sleep restriction on performance with within-subjects repeated-measures ANOVAs on the factors of Sleep Condition (fully rested vs sleep restricted) and Effort Level (1–6). We quantified performance in the cognitive effort task as a function of d′ (Z<sub>Hit Rate</sub> – Z<sub>False Alarm Rate</sub>).<xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> We used a log-linear correction for extreme values of hits or false alarms.<xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Performance in the physical effort task was measured as the proportion of time that participants were able to meet or exceed the target effort level on each trial.</p>
        <p>In the Choice Phase, we examined the effect of sleep restriction on the proportion of trials that individuals chose the more effortful offer relative to baseline. This was accomplished with a four-way repeated-measures ANOVA on the factors of Sleep Condition (fully rested, sleep restricted), Task Domain (cognitive, physical), and the Effort (2–6) and Reward (2–10) levels associated with the more effortful option. We applied Greenhouse–Geisser corrections for violations of sphericity.

        <title>Choice Phase: The Effects of Sleep Restriction on Motivation</title>
        <p>To address our principal question of whether sleep restriction differentially affected the willingness to exert cognitive vs physical effort, we examined the proportion of trials in which individuals chose the more effortful offer relative to baseline (<xref rid="f0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). We conducted a four-way ANOVA on the factors of Sleep Condition, Domain, Effort and Reward. The critical result was revealed by a significant three-way interaction between Sleep Condition x Domain x Effort (F(4, 92) = 4.96, p = 0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.18). Decomposing this interaction revealed that sleep restriction only reduced the motivation to exert effort within the cognitive domain, but not the physical domain. Furthermore, the effect of motivation on the cognitive domain was manifest at all but the lowest level of effort (level 2, p =. 443, levels 3–6, all p-values ≤ 0.040).
<fig position="float" id="f0003" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>The effects of sleep restriction on motivation.

        <p>The only other significant set of results was independent of the sleep manipulation. A significant Effort x Reward interaction simply reflected the expected finding that effort discounting was greatest at the lowest levels of reward (when individuals were more sensitive to effort), and minimal at the highest levels of reward (when the rewards outweighed all effort costs) (F(4.3, 98.0) = 11.83, p &lt; 0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.33). There was a trend towards Sleep Condition modulating this interaction (Sleep x Effort x Reward, F(5.6, 127.7) = 2.15, p = 0.057, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.09).</p>
        <p>Other main effects and interactions were either not significant or captured by the higher-order interactions above (Sleep, F(1, 23) = 3.79, p = 0.064, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.14; Domain, F(1, 23) = 0.03, p = 0.858, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.00; Effort, F(4, 92) = 62.30, p &lt; 0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.73; Reward, (F(4, 92) = 45.47, p &lt; 0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.66; Sleep x Domain, F(1, 23) = 7.51, p = 0.012, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.25; Sleep x Effort, F(1.98, 45.6) = 1.93, p = 0.156, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.08; Sleep x Reward, F(1.9, 43.2) = 2.87, p = 0.071, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.11; Domain x Effort, F(1.3, 30.8) = 0.34, p = 0.629, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.01; Sleep x Domain x Reward, F(2.8, 64.4) = 0.58, p = 0.617, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.03; Sleep x Domain x Effort x Reward (F(6.9, 159.3) = 0.91, p = 0.562, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.04).</p>
        <p>Overall, these data indicate that sleep restriction had a differential effect on the willingness to exert effort in the cognitive domain, and not in the physical domain. In order to compare our results with those of previous effort discounting studies, we also fit participants’ choices to commonly applied computational models of effort discounting. These data reaffirm the differential impact of sleep restriction on changing patterns of cognitive effort discounting, while having no effect on effort discounting in the physical domain.

        <title>Control Analyses</title>
        <p>The previous findings suggest that individuals had a lower motivation to invest cognitive effort when sleep restricted vs fully rested, which could be interpreted as evidence that sleep restriction leads to a heightened aversion to cognitively effortful behaviour. In principle, an alternate explanation could be that participants were disinclined to engage in greater effort due to a lower likelihood of completing those levels successfully. Importantly, this could not be the case here, as reinforcement rates in the cognitive effort task were at ceiling across all effort levels in both tasks (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Similarly, there was no consistent pattern of difference in performance (<italic toggle="yes">d`</italic>) in the fully rested vs sleep restricted conditions.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, in a control analysis, we formally verified that cognitive effort choices were not influenced by individuals’ capacity to perform the corresponding effort level. Importantly, performance in the cognitive task, quantified as <italic toggle="yes">d`</italic> for a given effort level, did not significantly explain individuals’ choices in either sleep condition (fully rested: Z = −1.17, p = 0.241; sleep restricted: Z = 0.14, p = 0.886). As expected, effort and reward both had significant effects on choice (fully rested: Effort, Z = −3.69, p = 0.002; Reward, Z = 3.97, p = 0.001; sleep restricted: Effort, Z = −4.11, p &lt;0.001; Reward, Z = 4.17, p &lt; 0.001).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Increasing evidence suggests that the motivation to engage in cognitively and physically effortful behaviour is dissociable.<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> However, the question of whether the effect of sleep loss is limited to particular domains of behaviour has not been addressed. Our main finding was that sleep restriction reduced the willingness of individuals to invest cognitive effort, but spared their willingness to engage in physically effortful behaviour. Importantly, the effects of sleep restriction on cognitive motivation could not have been driven by reduced capacity of individuals to perform each level of the cognitive effort task. This finding of a behavioural dissociation in the effect of sleep restriction on cognitive and physical motivation may have significant implications for those whose professions rely on optimal cognitive performance in spite of chronic sleep loss. In contrast, those occupations relying more heavily on physical effort may not see the same decrement in motivation to perform more physically demanding tasks during sleep loss.</p>
      <p>Our findings clarify the interpretation of recent studies which have reported that sleep loss decreases the willingness of individuals to engage in cognitively effortful tasks.<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In interpreting the effects of sleep loss on cognitive motivation, it is important to distinguish choices based on the aversiveness of effort itself versus the capacity of individuals to adequately perform the corresponding action. More effortful actions are typically associated with a performance decrement, as shown both in our data (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), and those of previous studies.<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> It is therefore important to determine whether the choice to engage in the less effortful option is indeed due to an aversion to higher effort, rather than simply a desire to avoid engaging in options that the individual is less capable of completing. Importantly, participants in our task were able to accomplish all levels of cognitive effort at ceiling performance (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, control analyses indicate that performance in the cognitive effort task could not account for the reduction in cognitive motivation caused by sleep restriction.</p>
      <p>Relatedly, previous studies have typically been manipulated effort by increasing the time it takes to complete a cognitive task (although see<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Considering that sleep loss has been found to accentuate the time-on-task decrements in cognitive performance,<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> reduced willingness to perform longer cognitive tasks under sleep restriction could be due to concerns about being able to sustain the required performance level. An important feature of our cognitive task was that we were able to manipulate attentional load while holding trial duration constant. Our results therefore serve to increase the specificity of prior findings, by showing that the effect of sleep loss on cognitive motivation likely represents a primary motivational deficit, rather than one driven by concerns about task performance.</p>
      <p>In contrast to cognitive effort, relatively few studies have examined the question of how sleep loss affects motivation in the physical domain. Those that have suggest that a reduction in sleep quality or quantity lowers the motivation to engage in physically effortful behaviour.<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> These reports may seem at odds with our results, which showed that sleep restriction had relatively little impact on motivation in the physical domain. However, key methodological differences between the current study and previous literature may explain the inconsistent results. Firstly, these earlier studies all utilised targeted groups of athletes, as opposed to the non-selective group of young adults recruited here. Unsurprisingly, previous work has shown that athletes have a higher motivation to invest physical effort relative to non-athletes.<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Thus, this apparent discrepancy could simply reflect an effect of sleep loss on physical motivation in cohorts that merely had a greater capacity to demonstrate such effects in the first place. Secondly, previous work on physical motivation has relied on subjective reports of sleep quality and quantity, in contrast to the highly controlled manipulation of sleep restriction we implemented here. Thus, it will be important for future work to directly address our speculation that an individual’s baseline level of physical motivation affects their response to physical effort under sleep restricted conditions.</p>
      <p>Our findings contribute to accumulating evidence from both behavioural tasks and neurophysiological studies that cognitive and physical motivation are dissociable.<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> For example, studies in neurological disease indicate that certain patient groups can have selective impairments that primarily affect a single domain of motivation,<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> although other patient groups may demonstrate more global deficits.<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Furthermore, recent studies indicate that the neural correlates of motivated behaviour comprise a network of regions, with some areas, such as amygdala, that are sensitive to individual domains of effort,<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> and other regions that are more domain-general, including the medial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum.<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="cit0048" ref-type="bibr">48–51</xref> Across many of these studies, it is clear that individuals vary widely in their motivation across the cognitive and physical domains. A logical extension of this work is to consider how sleep loss modulates neural activity across those areas involved in motivated behaviour – a question that is beginning to be addressed.<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>

      <p>In this study, we operationalised cognitive effort specifically in terms of sustained attention.

However, given the impact of sleep loss varies across cognitive domains,<xref rid="cit0054" ref-type="bibr">54–57</xref> the extent to which cognitive motivation is diminished in other types of cognitive tasks remains to be empirically demonstrated.</p>
      <p>Similarly, grip force is a common<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="cit0058" ref-type="bibr">58–62</xref> but not the only way to manipulate physical effort in an experimental setting.<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="cit0063" ref-type="bibr">63–66</xref> Of note, endurance tasks (eg running, cycling) appear to be more susceptible to the detrimental effects of sleep restriction than brief, strength-dependent tasks (eg weight-lifting).<xref rid="cit0064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="cit0066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="cit0067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref> Our task required sustaining grip force for 10 seconds.

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates a selective effect of sleep restriction on reducing cognitive vs physical motivation. Our data provide a compelling demonstration that sleep loss results in a primary deficit in cognitive motivation due to a heightened aversion to effort, while sparing motivation in the physical domain. These findings have significant implications for academic and professional settings that characteristically require maintaining high levels of cognitive motivation in the face of chronic sleep loss – such as in students and medical professionals. The detrimental effects of sleep loss on cognitive and physical performance are well recognised. Our data emphasise the importance of sleep, not only to optimise cognitive performance, but also to maintain the motivation to do so.</p>
