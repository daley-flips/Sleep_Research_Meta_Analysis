          <title>Purpose</title>
          <p>Sleep efficiency is inversely associated with cardiovascular risk. Brachial artery diameter and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) are noninvasive cardiovascular disease markers. We assessed the associations between sleep efficiency and these vascular markers in midlife adults, including people with sleep apnea.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="s2002">
          <title>Patients and Methods</title>
          <p>Thirty (18 males) participants completed an in-laboratory 8-hour sleep opportunity beginning at their habitual bedtimes. Polysomnography was used to assess sleep patterns and sleep efficiency (time asleep/time in bed). We measured systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and baseline diameter, and FMD immediately upon awakening in the morning. Mixed model analyses, adjusting for apnea-hypopnea and body mass indices, were used to assess the relationship between overnight sleep efficiency and cardiovascular markers. We also explored sex differences.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="s2003">
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Sleep efficiency was negatively associated with baseline brachial artery diameter (p = 0.005), systolic BP (p = 0.01), and diastolic BP (p = 0.02), but not flow-mediated dilation or heart rate (p &gt; 0.05). These relationships were confirmed with correlations between sleep efficiency and baseline diameter (r = −0.52, p = 0.004), systolic BP (r = −0.43, p = 0.017), and diastolic BP (r = −0.43, p = 0.019). There was a sex-specific interaction trend for sleep efficiency and arterial diameter (p = 0.07) and a significant sex-specific interaction (p &lt; 0.05) for BP, such that the relationships between sleep efficiency and cardiovascular markers were significant in women but not in men.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="s2004">
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>In midlife adults, poor sleep efficiency is associated with increased brachial artery diameter and blood pressure, effects that were primarily driven by significant associations in women. These associations could underlie the observed increase in cardiovascular risk in adults with poor sleep and cardiovascular disease.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Sleep is a fundamental behavior necessary for the optimal functioning of all physiological systems, including the cardiovascular (CV) system.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Habitual short sleep duration is independently associated with increased CV risk, including increased risk for adverse CV events, even after controlling for traditional risk factors, such as age and body mass index.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In addition to sleep duration, quality of sleep is also critical. For instance, sleep efficiency, which is a marker of sleep quality and defined as the ratio of sleep duration and total time in bed (analogous to total recording time when in the laboratory), is negatively associated with CV risk, including blood pressure and atherosclerosis.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4–7</xref> Furthermore, an 11-year longitudinal study from the Sleep Heart Health Study cohort (n = 3810) showed a strong inverse association between sleep efficiency, determined via at-home overnight polysomnography, and major adverse CV events.<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> However, the physiological mechanisms by which poor sleep efficiency increases CV disease risk are not well understood.</p>
      <p>Vascular endothelial function measured non-invasively as brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is a well-established cross-sectional and longitudinal marker of CV disease, with poorer dilation implying increased CV risk.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9–11</xref> Numerous studies have investigated the relationship between overnight sleep and FMD, but the findings are equivocal. Aggarwal and colleagues discovered that in adult women, subjective poor sleep quality measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was associated with increased endothelial nuclear factor kappa B activation but not associated with FMD.<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Scott and colleagues found similar results using actigraphically measured sleep in a small sample of young and predominantly male adults.<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In contrast, Cooper and colleagues discovered a positive relationship between FMD and sleep quality measured using PSQI and objectively measured rapid eye movement sleep.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Furthermore, in a sample of participants with existing CV risk (eg, hypertension), Hill and colleagues found a linear relationship between sleep efficiency determined using actigraphy and FMD.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p>
      <p>The discrepancies between these findings could be attributed to various factors, including the age groups studied, the presence of underlying sleep disorders, and the methodology of sleep measurement (subjective vs objective measurements). Indeed, subjective sleep markers are not robust predictors of CV risk,<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and isolated use of actigraphy can overestimate sleep.<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> More importantly, previous studies have likely not controlled for the marked time-of-day variation in FMD, as the timing of FMD measurements in these studies is often unreported. FMD has a time-of-day variation driven by the circadian system, with low FMD in the morning and a recovery by noon — a difference of nearly 75% between 6 AM and 11 AM.<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18–20</xref> The timing of the morning minimum in FMD also corresponds to the time window of increased frequency in major adverse CV events.<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> There is also evidence that baseline diameter measured as part of FMD is positively associated with CV risk.<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23–26</xref> Yet, previous reports have not specified the associations between sleep efficiency and baseline diameter. Finally, research on midlife adults in this area is generally lacking but is important considering midlife adults are likely to be at higher risk for CV disease than younger people and have an increased likelihood of an underlying sleep disorder that could impact CV health.<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Furthermore, overt sleep disorders that disrupt sleep quality, such as obstructive sleep apnea, have been found to impair FMD.<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p>
      <p>We aimed to explore the relationship between sleep efficiency, determined via gold-standard overnight in-laboratory polysomnography, and baseline diameter and FMD, measured in the morning while controlling for the effects of the internal body clock in midlife adults. We hypothesized that because midlife adults are likely to be at increased CV risk, overnight sleep efficiency will be positively associated with FMD and negatively associated with baseline diameter measured immediately upon awakening in the morning.<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> To increase clinical relevance, we also measured standard clinical CV variables, eg, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate (HR), and hypothesized that sleep efficiency would be inversely related to these parameters. Our sample also included people with untreated sleep apnea, which is a common disorder in midlife and can progressively increase CV risk with increasing severity of apnea by various mechanisms, including increased nocturnal blood pressure and increased variability in blood pressure.<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29–32</xref> Lastly, we explored sex differences as doing so could identify protective or maladaptive CV mechanisms in one group.<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p>

        <title>Participants</title>
        <p>We report data that were collected as part of a more extensive study of the circadian system’s effects on cardiovascular risk (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02202811). We have previously published limited circadian data from these studies.<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Volunteers were recruited using flyers on campus, internet research recruitment websites, and word of mouth.</p>
        <p>We excluded volunteers if they reported: 1) a history of any chronic disease (except untreated sleep apnea or untreated high blood pressure [BP &lt; 160/100 mmHg]); 2) pregnancy; 3) current smoking or a history of more than 5 pack-years; 4) use of any prescription or non-prescription medications, or 5) history of travel across more than three time zones in the last three months or shift work in the past six months. We verified the absence of recent drug or medication use by urinalysis (Drugsmart 12 panel cup, Speares Medical Inc, SC, USA). We confirmed non-smoking status by cotinine measurements (NicAlert<sup>®</sup>, Nymox Corporation, NJ, USA). Each participant also filled out numerous questionnaires, including two sleep profile questionnaires (Sleep Disorders Questionnaire and the Owl &amp; Lark Questionnaire), and underwent a clinical history interview, 12-lead electrocardiogram, clinical, biochemical screening tests of blood, and a physical examination. In addition, we determined each participant’s psychological suitability using the Beck Depression Inventory-II questionnaire and a structured interview (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview) with study staff approved by a physician. Participants were excluded if they had a history of severe psychiatric illnesses or psychiatric disorders and no history of treatment with antidepressants, neuroleptic medications, or major tranquilizers.</p>

        <title>Pre-Admission at-Home Routine</title>
        <p>To stabilize the internal body clock and sleep, for 1–3 weeks before the overnight study, we asked participants to maintain a self-selected overnight eight-hour schedule in bed. We monitored compliance to this schedule by 1) using a mobile actigraphy device (ActiGraph wGT3X-BT, Actigraph Corporation, FL, USA); 2) tracking participants’ call-ins to a time-stamped voicemail box before bed and upon waking; and 3) a detailed sleep diary.</p>

        <title>Inpatient Laboratory Studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1</xref>)</title>
        <p>Participants were admitted to the Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute (OCTRI) laboratory at OHSU approximately 6 hours after each individual’s habitual wake time determined from the at-home routine. Upon admission, we conducted a drug screen and pregnancy test (in pre-menopausal females). Following a negative screen, participants were fitted with polysomnography electrodes and transducers, and an intravenous line was placed in the non-dominant arm. Lights were set to ~150 lux initially and dimmed to &lt;3 lux approximately seven hours before the sleep opportunity. Six hours before the sleep opportunity, participants were provided with dinner devoid of antioxidants (eg, no oranges or raw tomatoes), chocolate, and caffeine. A light snack was provided 1.5 h before the sleep opportunity. Participants were provided a sleep opportunity in a sound-attenuated, temperature-controlled (20.6–22.2°C) and dark (&lt;1 lux) room at their habitual bedtime established during the at-home routine. Participants remained on bed rest throughout the sleep opportunity, except when they had to use a bedside commode (provided by research nursing while maintaining environmental conditions, including dim light and minimal sound). Eight hours after beginning the sleep opportunity, participants were awoken using a standardized mild auditory stimulus, and the light level was increased to ~3 lux. SBP, DBP, and HR were measured approximately 5 minutes after awakening in a supine position without a posture change, followed by an ultrasound assessment of brachial artery dimensions at rest (see details below).<fig id="f0001" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Protocol figure.

        <p>We first tested the data for outliers; data points outside the mean ± 3 SD were excluded from analyses. To decide whether to include participants with moderate-severe sleep apnea in the analyses, we used a Welch <italic>t</italic>-test to rule out significant differences between people with moderate or severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index≥15/hour) and no or mild OSA (apnea-hypopnea index &lt;15/hour) with regard to age, body mass index, sleep duration, efficiency, SBP, DBP, HR, and FMD. Subsequently, we performed a mixed model analysis to test if overnight sleep efficiency significantly predicted morning baseline diameter, FMD, SBP, DBP, and HR while controlling for apnea-hypopnea index and body mass index. Because hyperemic shear and resting baseline diameter can affect FMD response, we used four additional approaches for FMD: 1) we included baseline diameter as a covariate in the linear model, 2) we normalized FMD to SR<sub>auc</sub> as a dependent variable 3) we normalized FMD to SR<sub>auc</sub> as a dependent variable in addition to including baseline diameter as a covariate, and 4) we adjusted for allometrically scaled baseline diameter using a linear model with diameter change expressed in the natural log as a dependent variable and baseline diameter expressed in the natural log as a covariate.<xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> To further inform our results about FMD, we also assessed the relationship between baseline diameter and FMD. To corroborate the strength of relationships between sleep efficiency and CV variables, we conducted Pearson’s correlations. We did not adjust p-values for bivariate correlations because these CV variables are correlated with each other. To test if our results were affected by the presence of moderate- severe sleep apnea, we separately ran the analysis including only those people (apnea-hypopnea index &lt; 15/hour, n = 19).</p>
        <p>Finally, using the entire dataset, we ran an additional model by adding sex as a group variable and sleep efficiency × sex as an interaction term to explore sex differences.

Based on our results, a 5% decrease in sleep efficiency could lead to a 0.2 mm increase in baseline brachial artery diameter. Baseline brachial artery diameter is directly associated with increased cardiovascular risk, specifically decreasing cardiovascular event-free survival by 15% for each 1 mm increase in baseline diameter.<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23–26</xref> It has previously been shown that an increase in brachial artery diameter is likely a homeostatic and adaptive process to maintain vascular shear in the presence of cardiovascular risk factors.<xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> It can also be a maladaptive process in the face of aging.<xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Additionally, our participants were devoid of any overt chronic disease (except sleep apnea), but because this was a midlife sample, we cannot exclude the presence of subclinical cardiovascular disease, especially because disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea can accelerate vascular aging.<xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Still, our results persisted after controlling for the apnea–hypopnea index. One person had a surprisingly low sleep efficiency (53%) that could be due to sleep apnea (AHI=22.9/h) or a first night effect.<xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> The contribution of this individual was tested in a sensitivity analysis.

        <p>Discussion of potential mechanisms is speculative at this point, and more experimental work needs to be done in a larger sample to reproduce these findings. It is unlikely that one night of low sleep efficiency may change baseline brachial artery diameter. Indeed, we showed in a previous study that baseline morning brachial artery diameter does not differ depending on whether participants slept or stayed awake through the preceding night.<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> However, sleep timing in the current study was selected based on our participants’ habitual sleeping behaviors, and thus we would hypothesize that our observations may be indicative of a chronic sleep phenotype.

We studied midlife (mean age 51 years) and overweight (mean BMI 29.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) adults who are likely at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease than the younger population previously studied to answer this question. Our participants were in bed for an 8 h sleep opportunity at habitual timing in a light-controlled environment, thereby avoiding any changes in circadian timing of the sleep episode that could disrupt sleep.<xref rid="cit0058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> However, we cannot discount the wake-promoting system’s overactivity due to the first-night effect due to sleeping in a new environment,<xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> or the effect on sleep efficiency due to limiting the time in bed to 8 h.

We cannot infer causality and could not examine mechanisms underlying the relationship between sleep efficiency and CV markers, which are limitations. Since these data were collected as part of multi-day circadian protocols requiring data collection across the day and the night, it was not possible to have a single sonographer make all measurements. Staffing for these studies was variable to avoid systemic effects. The sonographer training in our laboratory consists of individualized hands-on training and the collection of at least 20 full FMD images under the supervision of an experienced operator. Formal feedback is provided after each set of 5 images. Subsequently, new operators are required to acquire at least an additional 10 (5 consecutive) polished images verified by an expert. For continued practice, all operators make approximately 100 measurements each year. For analysis, the intra-class correlation between analyzers needs to be ≥0.9. Our rigorous selection of participants, self-selected strict at-home sleep routine before the in-laboratory visit, excellent experimental control all considerably strengthen the confidence in our findings. Properly powered studies using at least two nights of polysomnography (to account for a first night effect) are perhaps essential to conclusively assess the relationship between sleep efficiency and FMD.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, we discovered that in midlife adults, overnight sleep efficiency is inversely associated with baseline brachial artery diameter and SBP and DBP, but not FMD or HR. These associations were driven by a significant effect in women, but not in men. Future studies in people with existing cardiovascular risk are warranted to understand the clinical significance of these findings. If these findings persist in adults with existing cardiovascular disease, disturbed sleep could be implicated as a mechanism in the morning increase in adverse cardiovascular events.</p>
