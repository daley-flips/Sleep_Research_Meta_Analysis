      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Polysomnography (PSG) is a standard investigation to analyze human sleep and diagnose sleep disorders. It involves full night recording of multiple scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) channels, electromyogram (EMG), electrooculogram (EOG), single channel electrocardiogram (ECG), limb movement signals, nasal airflow, chest and abdominal movement signals, oximetry, snoring and body position signals.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Subsequently, PSG data are reviewed and associated events are scored by a sleep technologist in a format appropriate for diagnosis of sleep disorders. As sleep staging is the major component of PSG data analysis, the guidelines of American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommend continuous recording of the minimum of three EEG channels (frontal, central and occipital) referenced to the mastoid process as well as right and left EOG channels and chin EMG.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Given its complexity, PSG investigation has been recommended to be performed in the sleep laboratory in attendance of a sleep technologist.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p>
      <p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition of disordered breathing characterized by intermittent partial (hypopnea) and/or complete (apnea) upper airway obstruction during sleep. These apneic events lead to hypercapnia, hypoxemia, sympathetic stimulation and fragmentation of the sleep architecture by arousals, which often accompany these events. This subsequently leads to impairment of daytime function<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and there is also evidence that repeated cortical arousals and hypoxemia contribute to increased mortality from cardiovascular disease in these patients.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>
      <p>Given the high prevalence of OSA,<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> its heavy burden on population health and availability of effective treatments, as well as the excessive complexity and cost of PSG, the unattended home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) has emerged as a simpler and cheaper diagnostic option. The recommended HSAT configurations<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> typically do not include the channels required for sleep staging and constitute the type 3 diagnostic sleep studies, recommended for the initial diagnosis and longitudinal management of OSA.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5–8</xref> The type 3 devices include those based on pulse arterial tonometry (PAT),<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> that may incorporate non-EEG based sleep staging algorithms. Misclassification of OSA was reported for these devices,<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> which can be at least partially attributed to the limitations of their sleep staging algorithms.<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> It was shown that type 3 studies may underestimate the presence and/or severity of OSA due to inability to correctly measure total sleep time (TST) and record arousals<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> with the latter factor also responsible for not reporting the respiratory event related arousals (RERA) and subsequently further underestimating respiratory disturbance index (RDI). Lack or inferior accuracy of sleep staging in type 3 HSAT does not allow to perform proper phenotyping of OSA specifically of the REM phenotype.<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p>
      <p>Type 2 diagnostic studies are unattended home recordings that include at least one channel of EEG, EOG and EMG<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and are therefore capable of reporting sleep stages and overcoming the deficiencies of type 3 HSAT devices. The Australasian recommendation<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> for the limited channel studies states that the central derivation C4-M1 should be used if only one EEG channel is available. This recommendation is based solely on the findings<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> of only a small shift in the sleep stages and no significant difference in the arousals when a single C4-M1 derivation was used instead of all three EEG channels. The major limiting factors in type 2 studies compared to type 3 studies are the difficulty of “wiring up” the patient which requires the sleep technician for the most reliable recording,<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and a number of wires attached to the head that may prevent the patient from sleeping in their natural position and therefore compromise the correct assessment and phenotyping of OSA.<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> It would be important to investigate feasibility of accurate sleep staging based on the minimum number of electrodes attached to a small area on the forehead which would ensure simple and reliable self-application by the patient and the least invasiveness of overnight sleep.</p>
      <p>While similarly to the approach used a prior study,<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> the early commercial single channel sleep staging algorithms utilized the central EEG derivations,<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> with the advent of HSAT the focus shifted to investigation of the role of the frontal EEG in sleep staging and evaluation of the automatic algorithms based on the frontal EEG. It was demonstrated<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> that kappa for overall sleep staging agreement between manual scoring from the single frontal channel (Fpz-M1) and from the full PSG was 0.72 and 0.73 for the two scorers, and epoch by epoch sleep/wake percent agreement was 92% and 95% respectively. Investigation of Michele Sleep Scoring<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> found that its performance on single channel EEG was as accurate with the frontal as with the central EEG derivations. The performance of Sleep Profiler device utilizing Fp1-Fp2 for EEG was reported.<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23–29</xref> The Sleep Profiler algorithm uses a rule based combination of spectral analysis, feature extraction and decision tree. The reported values of kappa statistics for agreement between the Sleep Profiler algorithm and the parallel PSG manual scoring were 0.61, 0.62,<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and 0.63<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> in the investigation groups including the OSA sufferers, and 0.76 and 0.74 for the healthy participants.<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> When the accuracy of manual staging from the Sleep Profiler frontal electrode and the expert adjusted algorithm accuracy were analyzed in the groups with suspected OSA,<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> the values of kappa were 0.67 in both studies, with the mean overall percent agreement at 73.9% for the latter case.<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> It was also shown<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> that the power values of submental and frontal EMG were similar during wakefulness and sleep, thus further supporting suitability of the frontal montages for sleep staging. Another automatic algorithm for F4-M1 derivation utilizing a combination of feature extraction based on spectral analysis and a decision tree based on neural network reported kappa of 0.62 and percent agreement of 75.5% for the four categories (with N1 and N2 merged into light sleep) in the investigation group comprising 60% of participants with OSA.<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p>
      <p>In recent years further significant improvement in the accuracy of sleep staging algorithms was achieved with application of Deep Learning (DL) models and software tools.<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Several publications<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32–43</xref> investigated application of DL to development of single EEG channel sleep staging algorithms, typically using multilayer convolutional neural networks (CNN)<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> or different implementations of recurrent neural networks (RNN)<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> or combinations of CNN and RNN.<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> While most of these algorithms demonstrate very high percent agreement with manual PSG that significantly exceeds 80% and even 85% for some configurations<xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> it must be taken into account that these results were mostly achieved for the public sleep databases which often only include the healthy participants and the artifact free signals. Importantly it is demonstrated<xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> that for the preferred DL model (bidirectional LSTM with attention<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) sleep staging accuracy is highest at 81.72% for the frontal derivation (Fp1-A1) compared to 81.62% and 77.09% for the central (Cz-A1) and occipital (O1-A1) derivations respectively. A combined CNN-RNN (with bidirectional LSTM) DL model<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> was trained on a clinical data set of 717 diagnostic patients with suspected OSA, and achieved the respective accuracies of 82.9% on the single F4-M1 EEG channel and 83.8% on a combination of F1-M1 EEG channel and E1-M2 EOG channel when tested on 87 recordings from the same data set.</p>
      <p>The accuracy of any sleep staging algorithm when it is compared with the manual scoring should be interpreted only in the context of interscorer agreement. The level of interscorer agreement varies significantly depending on the study population and affiliation of the scorers.<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Typically interscorer agreement decreases for OSA population compared to the healthy participants and also with increase in the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), and increases for scorers from the same facility following common training procedures. This was demonstrated by the scorers from SHHS study<xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> who achieved the values of percent agreement between 86.8 and 88.1% and kappa statistics in the range of 0.81–0.83 despite a significant AHI between 14 and 15 in the study group. For all other reported interrater agreement studies involving the OSA populations, the levels of agreement were significantly lower. The reported percent agreement for 38 subjects with sleep disordered breathing was 71%.<xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> The percent agreement and kappa for 31 subjects with mean AHI of 22 were reported at 82% and 0.73 respectively.<xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> The mean percent agreement in a study<xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> with a large number of scorers was reported at 82.6% on a data set with a small proportion of OSA patients. Mean percent agreement for the three scorers from different institutions and the data set with mean AHI of 15.8 was 77%.<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Mean percent agreement for the two scorers on a data set of 56 subjects with 50% OSA sufferers was 78.9%<xref rid="cit0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> A study of eight different sleep centres<xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> reported mean percent agreement and kappa of 76.8% and 0.68 respectively on a data set of 198 recordings with a mixture of sleep disorders. Another study with five sleep technologists and a mixed data set of 63 participants (52% OSA) revealed the mean interscorer percent agreement of 75.9%.<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p>
      <p>Compumedics has developed a new miniaturized sleep monitoring device – Somfit (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), which is attached to the patient’s forehead and combines the channels specified for a PAT-based HSAT device (oximetry and PAT, plus oximetry derived pulse rate, snoring and accelerometry derived head positions, angles and motion) with the neurological signals representing EEG, EOG and EMG derivations. The first evaluation of Somfit is presented for the early rule based sleep staging algorithm.<xref rid="cit0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> Recently a new DL based sleep staging algorithm was developed for Somfit. The objective of this study was to evaluate the latest Somfit sleep staging algorithm in a target clinical population, which is a combination of the patients with suspected OSA and those with known OSA requiring ongoing management.

        <p>A total of 110 participants were enrolled in the study, which involved simultaneous recording of full overnight PSG and Somfit data. Eligible participants were patients who were referred for a sleep diagnostic study and satisfied at least one of the following criteria:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Referral includes suspected sleep disordered breathing based on the judgement of a referring sleep physician;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients have already been diagnosed with sleep disordered breathing and require a diagnostic study as part of their ongoing OSA management.

        <p>Offers to participate in the study were made to the patients as they presented to the center in the order they presented. To confirm the high pretest probability of sleep apnea, the participants were asked to complete Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) questionnaire.</p>
        <p>The recordings were conducted at the three centers in Australia:

        <title>Somfit Sleep Staging Algorithm</title>
        <p>The Somfit sleep staging algorithm is based on DL U-sleep CNN architecture.<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> It comprises 12 combinations of encoder and decoder units that take 35 consecutive 30 second epochs of EEG and EOG data as a two-dimensional input, map the input signals into a sequence of up to 302-dimensional feature spaces and then determine the probabilities of the five sleep stages for each one of the 35 epochs. As required by AASM,<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Somfit records two EOG channels – right and left, therefore the inference model estimates the probabilities of sleep stages for the two input pairs – EEG+EOG (right) and EEG+EOG (left), then adds the respective probabilities and selects the stage with the highest combined probability as the output of the algorithm. This architecture was initially trained on 783 Somfit studies with the manual Somfit hypnograms used as the ground truth. The final model comprises more than three million optimized weight coefficients. To improve detection of stage N1, another similar DL architecture was trained on 216 parallel Somfit and PSG recordings with the long continuous stretches of stage N3 excluded from training and the manual PSG hypnograms used as the ground truth. If the second model detects N1, it overrules the output of the first model, if that output is Wake or N2 within 10 min of the nearest Wake epoch.</p>

        <p>The same statistics were generated to characterize the level of agreement between different manual PSG hypnograms.</p>
        <p>Linear Mixed Models (LMM) with random intercepts were used to examine the significant differences (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&lt;0.05) between the measures of Somfit/PSG agreement and interscorer agreement as well as between the estimates of agreement for different combinations of sleep stages. In addition to examination of superiority (that required non-negativity of 95% confidence interval of a respective regression coefficient) we explored noninferiority of the Somfit algorithm with respect to interscorer agreement. The margin of noninferiority [M<sub>NI</sub>] was set at 5% for percent agreement, 0.05 for kappa statistic and 5% for the individual sleep stage performance measures based on the range of reported interscorer variability in various settings.<xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43–49</xref> To establish noninferiority with LMM, 95% confidence interval of a respective regression coefficient had to fall within [-M<sub>NI</sub>;∞]. ANOVA was used to test for the different mean agreement measures between the centers and sample categories (OSA presence/severity, gender, age, BMI). Repeated measures ANOVA was used to test for the different mean agreement measures between the pairs of scorers form the same center. Unpaired <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test was used to examine the significant differences between the sample categories with the hypothesized direction of change in the level of agreement. Stata 15 (StataCorp) statistical software was used for statistical analysis.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>There were significant discrepancies in some patient characteristics between different centers. While almost all patients enrolled at Centers 1 and 3 only had suspected OSA, the majority of the patients enrolled at Center 2 had a known history of OSA and required diagnostic review, primarily due to a significant recent weight change. This resulted in overrepresentation of the moderate and severe OSA populations at Center 2 (two thirds of the enrolled participants) compared to the Centers 1 and 3 at 35% and 39%, respectively. Despite that, the hypothesis of no difference in the mean ESS between the centers could not be rejected, most likely because majority of the participants at Center 2 were on CPAP at home. Overall, the distribution of different OSA categories at 20%, 34%, 19%, and 27% for healthy, mild, moderate and severe OSA is similar to the respective values of 17%, 31%, 23%, and 29% reported for a data set of 891 consecutive diagnostic studies in a large Australian public sleep unit.<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p>
      <p>Review of interscorer agreement (<xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and <xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) indicated that the mean overall percent agreement at Center 1 was consistently high at about 85% between all pairs of scorers, while for the other two centers it was under 80%, except the value of 83.90% between the scorers A and C at Center 3. The likely causes of such discrepancy are long-term affiliation of all scorers used by Center 1 with the same sleep laboratory and predominance of healthy and mild OSA cases at this center compared to the other centers. The overall percent agreement levels of under 80% are widely reported for the data sets with significant OSA representation and the scorers affiliated with different sleep centers.<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="cit0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>
<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> shows that the respective mean kappa statistic estimates are above 0.78 for Center 1 and around 0.7 or lower for most comparisons at the other two centers. The estimates for the Center 1 are close to the range of 0.81–0.83 reported for the scorers following the same training procedure,<xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> while the lower estimates for the Centers 2 and 3 are consistent with the values of 0.73 and 0.68 reported for the multicenter studies with significant OSA representation.<xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> Our findings for kappa are also consistent with the overall meta-analysis estimate of 0.76<xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> which summarizes the reported interrater agreement investigations. Considering the individual sleep stages the reported lowest interscorer agreement for Stage N1,<xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> in comparison with the other stages, is confirmed by our findings of mean interscorer N1 sensitivity at 45.79 for all participants and 40.20 for the Centers 2 and 3 combined. As the scorers for Centers 2 and 3 were not trained at the same sleep laboratories, all measures of agreement indicated within center differences for these two Centers in contrast to those at Center 1. Particular prominent patterns of interscorer disagreement included the tendency of Scorer B from Center 2 to score sleep stages in a more “blocky” fashion in contrast to the other scorers more likely to present the fragmented hypnograms, and also a tendency of Scorer B from Center 3 to discriminate between sleep and wake more strictly according to AASM rules in contrast to the other scorers who appear to also take into account the breathing and desaturation patterns. Such differences in sleep scoring patterns lead to significant disagreements in the recordings of patients with moderate and severe OSA which is also confirmed by the outcomes of ANOVA tests between the centers.</p>
      <p>Results of percent agreement between Somfit automatic hypnogram and consensus PSG hypnogram (<xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and <xref rid="f0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) at different centers demonstrate similar mean estimates at 75.91%, 74.72%, and 77.82%, with the lowest mean agreement at Centre 2, which had the largest combined proportion of moderate and severe OSA at 67%. ANOVA confirms no difference in means at the three centers for all comparison categories, As demonstrated in <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, percent agreement estimates for all centers consistently increased when the number of categories was reduced from the five sleep stages to four (N1 and N2 merged to light NREM), then to three (NREM-REM-Wake), and finally to two (Sleep-Wake) with respective mean percentages at different centers being within two percent of each other. For the total data set, the respective mean percent agreement estimates increased from 76% to 81% when N1 and N2 were merged, to above 86% for the three categories – NREM-REM-Wake, and then to above 89% for the sleep/wake discrimination. The high value of the latter number would contribute to reliability of the AHI values reported by Somfit, as they rely on an accurate TST. <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> demonstrates that the Somfit algorithm percent agreement across five categories is noninferior to PSG interscorer agreement for the three out of nine pairwise comparisons, and also for the average interscorer percent agreements at Centers 2 and 3. There are also a number of noninferior comparisons at Centers 2 and 3 with the reduced sets of categories, however none of the comparisons for Centre 1 reveal noninferiority of the Somfit algorithm. The relationships for the N1-N2-N3-REM-Wake comparisons are further highlighted in <xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> with 95% confidence intervals for all percent agreement estimates.</p>
      <p>All estimates of kappa (<xref rid="t0003 t0005 t0007" ref-type="table">Tables 3, 5, 7</xref> and also <underline><ext-link xlink:href="https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=463026.docx" ext-link-type="uri">S5</ext-link></underline>, <underline><ext-link xlink:href="https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=463026.docx" ext-link-type="uri">S7</ext-link></underline> and <underline><ext-link xlink:href="https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=463026.docx" ext-link-type="uri">S9</ext-link></underline> in the Supplement) reveal the reduction of up to 0.02 with the change from the pooled confusion matrix (right column), that is typically used in the publications, to the estimates based on kappa for individual studies (left column), that appears more relevant to the research questions and amenable to the correct statistical analysis. Such difference can be explained by the fact that the individual studies with lower kappa impact the overall estimate to the greater extent when they are included into analysis directly rather via the pooled confusion matrix. Similar to the percent agreement, there is no difference between mean kappa estimates at the three centers, with the mean kappa for the full data set at 0.654, or 0.672 if the pooled confusion matrix method is used (<xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). According to <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, kappa for the agreement between Somfit and PSG consensus is noninferior to PSG interscorer kappa only for the pairs A/B and B/C at Center 3.</p>
      <p>The presented percent agreement and kappa estimates demonstrate that the accuracy of Somfit sleep staging algorithm most likely exceeds that reported by Sleep Profiler<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and the frontal EEG algorithm<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> for the data sets including OSA sufferers. The range of kappa statistic for those studies was between 0.61 and 0.63. However, the DL algorithm based on a combination of EEG derivation F4-M1 and EOG derivation E1-M2 reported the higher reported accuracy of 83.8% and kappa of 0.78.<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> We will comment further on possible reasons for such discrepancy and outline the steps suggested to improve the accuracy of the Somfit algorithm.</p>
      <p><xref rid="t0008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref> shows that the sensitivity of the stages N2 and REM is noninferior for Somfit with respective to the mutual PSG interscorer sensitivities, however the sensitivities of Wake, N1 and N3 are not noninferior and in fact the respective PSG interscorer sensitivities are superior. While the sensitivity of Wake is not noninferior, it is still relatively high at 78.23% for the full data set. However the sensitivities of N3 and especially N1 are significantly lower for the Somfit algorithm. The reduction in N3 sensitivity is exacerbated by the fact that our analysis did not use the pooled confusion matrix, so the moderate/severe OSA studies with small N3 durations and likely underestimation of N3 by Somfit would have significant impact on the mean estimate for the complete data set. It is well established that detection of stage N1 is the most difficult for both automatic algorithms and interscorer agreement<xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> which is supported by the respective accuracies of 23% and 47% reported by Sleep Profiler<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and DL algorithm.<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> The correct detection of N1 is more challenging for the frontal EEG derivations owing to the greater distance from the occipital placement preferred for detection of the alpha patterns.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="t0008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref> includes the estimates for the partial date set formed by Centers 2 and 3 to eliminate the effect of scorer training at the same center. This does not change the outcome of sensitivity analysis however for a number of performance measures (specificity and accuracy of Wake and PPV of N1) noninferiority can be established for the reduced data set in contrast to the full data set.</p>
      <p>The hypothesized reduction in the level of agreement with the increase in OSA severity was only established for some comparisons – with transitions from no OSA or mild OSA to severe OSA for the five categories percent agreement and kappa, as well with transitions from no OSA to moderate or severe OSA for NREM-REM-Wake and Sleep-Wake percent agreement (<xref rid="t0006" ref-type="table">Tables 6</xref> and <xref rid="t0007" ref-type="table">7</xref> and <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), despite the consistent trends for the mean estimates across all OSA severity categories. These observations are supported by the findings for interscorer agreement<xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> and for the accuracy of sleep staging algorithms.<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Similar trends without the significant differences, except reduction in kappa between the normal and overweight BMI, were observed when we compared the genders (<underline><ext-link xlink:href="https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=463026.docx" ext-link-type="uri">Tables S4</ext-link></underline> and <underline><ext-link xlink:href="https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=463026.docx" ext-link-type="uri">S5</ext-link></underline> and <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), age groups (<underline><ext-link xlink:href="https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=463026.docx" ext-link-type="uri">Tables S6</ext-link></underline> and <underline><ext-link xlink:href="https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=463026.docx" ext-link-type="uri">S7</ext-link></underline> and <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) and BMI categories (<underline><ext-link xlink:href="https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=463026.docx" ext-link-type="uri">Tables S8</ext-link></underline> and <underline><ext-link xlink:href="https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=463026.docx" ext-link-type="uri">S9</ext-link></underline> and <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Presence and increasing severity of OSA and the subsequent increase in sleep fragmentation is most likely the main factor responsible for reduction in algorithm accuracy.</p>
      <p>A contributing factor into reduction in the level of agreement for the Somfit algorithm with the PSG hypnograms was that every full night Somfit study (except the one from Center 3 with almost continuous electrode disconnection) was included in the data analysis. Five studies (two from Center 1–10 and 35, one from Center 2–20 and two from Center 3–4 and 11) revealed the noisy EEG signals as a consequence of incorrect electrode application and/or excessive patient movement. The range of percent agreement with the consensus PSG hypnogram for these five studies was between 48% and 62% resulting in significant impact on the overall level of agreement. In two of these studies (4 and 11 from Center 3) the PSG signals also had excessive high frequency resulting in very poor interscorer percent agreement of as low as 38% for one pair of scorers. It was evident that a small percentage of severe OSA studies demonstrated very noisy appearance of EEG/EOG signals not only for Somfit, but also on a number of occasions for PSG recordings. In addition to these observations there were inconsistencies with the manual scoring of stage N3 at Center 1, resulting in apparent overdetection of N3 by Center 1 scorers. This factor resulted in relatively poor overall percent agreement for a number of studies at Center 1, for example 17, 23 and 33, and the pooled confusion matrix sensitivity for Stage N3 at this center being at 59%, while staying above 69% for the other two centers.</p>
      <p>Regarding the comparison of our results with those reported for the combined frontal EEG and EOG DL algorithm<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> we believe that there were multiple factors responsible for the difference in performance:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>DL algorithm<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> excluded about 5% of consecutive diagnostic studies;</p></list-item><list-item><p>DL algorithm<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> was trained and tested on studies recorded at the same center and scored by the same scorers;</p></list-item><list-item><p>The average interscorer agreement in our study was 80.43% therefore it is unlikely that the agreement of Somfit algorithm with the PSG consensus can be higher than this level;</p></list-item><list-item><p>The mean AHI for the study<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> was 15.8 while it was 21.1 for our study which makes it more challenging for the sleep staging algorithm performance;</p></list-item><list-item><p>DL algorithm<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> utilized EEG and EOG derivations referenced to the mastoid process which makes the signal patterns cleaner but this diagnostic set-up problematic for self-application.</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>While the presented results demonstrate that the accuracy of the Somfit sleep staging algorithm approaches the level of interrater agreement for accredited sleep technologists, this study also allows to identify a number of steps for further improvement of the algorithm to realize the maximum potential of the DL approach:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Integration of a DL arousal detection algorithm and retraining of a DL sub-model for stage N1 on a larger simultaneous Somfit/PSG data set (500 studies plus) to rectify “blocky” appearance of a hypnogram, represent sleep fragmentation more accurately and lift the stage N1 sensitivity to the level of at least 50%;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Addition of a DL sub-model for stage N3 trained on a simultaneous Somfit/PSG data set to increase the stage N3 accuracy to the level of at least 80%;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Exploration of a larger training data set and possibility of addition of the Somfit motion signal to the main DL model to rectify occasional misclassification of Wake as REM sleep – examples of such errors can be found in studies 22 and 28 from Center 3;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Addition of single channel DL models or DL models based on non-EEG Somfit channels (motion, SpO2, PAT) to be activated under the conditions of excessive noise or high impedance.</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>The results of the study also imply that, with the possibility of manual editing, the Somfit data are likely to be immediately fully adequate for producing the hypnograms of equivalent accuracy to the full PSG. As also supported by the results<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and a number of other single channel DL models,<xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> the separate chin EMG signal may not necessarily be required to produce valid hypnograms for the correct diagnosis of OSA.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Our multicenter clinical trial in a population with suspected or known OSA investigated the performance of a sleep staging algorithm implemented in Compumedics Somfit, a miniaturized HSAT device attached to a patient’s forehead. We established that the estimates of agreement between the Somfit hypnogram and simultaneous PSG hypnogram were noninferior to the level of PSG interscorer agreement for a number of indicators. It was possible to achieve a high level of algorithm accuracy owing to the application of deep learning methodology.</p>
