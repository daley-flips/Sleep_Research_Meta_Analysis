          <title>Aim</title>
          <p>Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a prevalent chronic disease characterized by sleep fragmentation and intermittent hypoxemia. Several studies suggested that electrophysiological changes and neurocognitive abnormalities occurred in OSAS patients. In this study, we compared automatic processing of emotional facial expressions schematic in OSAS patients and matched healthy controls via assessing expression-related mismatch negativity (EMMN).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="s2002">
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>Twenty-two OSAS patients (mean age 44.59 years) and twenty-one healthy controls (mean age 42.71 years) were enrolled in this study. All participants underwent Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale test and polysomnographic recording. An expression-related oddball paradigm was used to elicit EMMN and the electroencephalogram was recorded and analyzed. Furthermore, Pearson’s correlations were calculated to discuss the correlation between neuropsychological test scores, clinical variables and electrophysiological data.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="s2003">
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Compared with healthy controls, OSAS sufferers demonstrated significantly reduced EMMN mean amplitudes within corresponding time intervals, regardless of happy or sad conditions. Meanwhile, we observed that amplitude of sad EMMN was larger (more negative) than happy EMNN in healthy controls, while not in patients. Moderate correlations were found between MoCA test scores, sleep parameters and EMMN amplitudes.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="s2004">
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>Our findings suggested pre-attentive dysfunction of processing emotional facial expressions in patients with OSAS, without the existence of negative bias effect. Moreover, correlation analysis showed that clinical characteristics of OSAS patients could affect EMMN amplitudes. Further studies on the advantages of EMMN as clinical and electrophysiological indicators of OSAS are warranted.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a common sleep-related breathing disorder due to upper airway obstruction that results in apnea or hypopnea, which further leads to hypercapnia, sleep fragmentation and intermittent hypoxemia.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Such disorders with sleep alterations are regarded as the underlying causes of cognitive dysfunction in OSAS.<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Individuals with OSAS often feel unrested, fatigued, and sleepy during the day, which may be due to hypoxemia and sleep fragmentation.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Recent international study indicates that the estimated prevalence of OSAS is 14% in men and 5% in women.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> A research suggests that OSAS may promote the development of neurodegenerative disease.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Many studies have reported many domains of neurocognitive impairments in patients with OSAS, including selective attention,<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> information processing speed,<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> working memory.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>
      <p>Emotion processing is an advanced cognitive process that plays an important role in interpersonal communication. In addition, facial expressions are important ecological stimulus (emotional stimulus) as they convey the most fundamental information such as an individual’s mood and intention in social interactions, promoting interpersonal communication and accurate and integrated perception of emotional information is vital for effective social communication. Clinical evidence suggests that OSAS can cause mood regulation disorders, leading to aggressive behavior, depressive and anxiety disorders.<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> While to our knowledge, direct research on socio-emotional processing in OSAS is not available at present, which demands further elucidation.</p>

      <p>The phenomenon that biological stimuli could elicit vMMN has been verified.

      <p>To our knowledge, there is no study investigating automatic changes in processing facial expressions of OSAS patients via the EMMN component. Thus, in the present study, we measured EMMN elicited by schematic facial expressions (neutral, happy and sad) with an expression-related oddball paradigm and explored correlations between EMMN amplitudes and clinical characteristics. This study is the first to investigate the characteristics of expression-related vMMN in patients with OSAS to further understand the neurocognitive information of expression processing at the pre-attentive stage. We hypothesized that OSAS patients suffered from cognitive impairment of facial expression at the pre-attentive stage.</p>

The exclusion criteria included factors that may cause cognitive impairment and affect sleep or daytime sleepiness, including other sleep disorders, dementia, cerebrovascular disease, history of brain traumatic injury, psychiatric disorders (ie, depression, psychosis, and anxiety disorders), chronic respiratory disease, alcohol/drug abuse such as antidepressants, hypnotics.</p>
        <p>In addition, 7 OSAS patients (3 males) were excluded – three patients for drift artefacts and excessive blink interference within electroencephalogram (EEG) data, four remaining for incomplete or lost clinical data. Finally, we included 22 OSAS patients (17 males). As for all healthy controls (normal: AHI &lt; 5), five participants (2 males) had to be excluded. Three for technical problems during recording and two for excessive blink interference. Thus, total of 21 healthy controls (11 males) were included for further analysis.</p>

Each stimulus lasted for 150ms, with an inter-stimulus interval (offset-to-onset) of 450ms and a visual angle of 3.8°×4.0° at a 70 cm viewing distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1</xref>).<fig id="f0001" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Samples of the fixation cross and standard (neutral faces) and deviant stimuli (happy or sad faces) that were mediated by altering the shape and distance between the facial features.</p></caption><graphic content-type="print-only" xlink:href="NSS-12-637-g0001"/></fig></p>

The target stimuli, fixation crosses with enlarging sizes, were always shown at the center of the screen, which prevented contamination by artifacts associated with motor response and active tasks. The changes in the size of the fixation cross were independent of the presentation of different facial expressions (neutral, happy and sad), and participants were instructed that emotional faces on two sides of screen did not relate to their performance on the task. Three sequences were conducted with 211 trials for each (standard: 151 neutral faces; deviant: 30 happy and 30 sad faces). To establish a sensory memory pattern, 10 standard stimuli (neutral faces) were shown at the beginning of the stimulus sequence, and there were at least two standards between successive deviants. The participants were seated in a quiet and electrical shielding room between 10:00 and 11:00 a.m., and were asked to pay attention to unpredictable changes in the cross (“+”) at the center of the screen and respond by pressing the button (“/”) on the keyboard as rapidly as possible, while ignoring facial stimuli on both sides of the cross.

Subsequent comparisons demonstrated that significant differences existed under both happy condition (0.36 ± 0.18μV and –0.29 ± 0.18μV for OSAS patients and HC, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = 0.014) and sad condition (0.26 ± 0.15μV and –0.86 ± 0.16μV for OSAS patients and HC, respectively; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). In HC group, sad EMMN (–0.86 ± 0.16μV) was found to be larger than happy EMMN (0.29 ± 0.18μV, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001), but not in patients with OSAS (<italic>P</italic> = 0.490).</p>
        <p>In order to further demonstrate the existence of EMMN, the EMMN amplitude of each group was compared to zero. For early and late EMMN of HC group, the mean amplitude of EMMN at each channel was significantly different from zero (<italic>P</italic>s &lt; 0.01), regardless of happy or sad faces, except for the mean amplitude of EMMN elicited by happy facial expressions at the M1/M2 channel (all <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). On the contrary, in the OSAS group, these comparisons did not reach significant levels for both happy EMMN and sad EMMN (all <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05), indicating the absence of early EMMN, regardless of happy or sad conditions.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the present study, using an expression-related oddball paradigm to investigate pre-attentive processing of facial expressions, we found that although the reaction time for detecting cross change did not differ between two groups, the amplitude of EMMN declined significantly in patients with OSAS compared with HC, regardless of sad or happy condition. In addition, these electrophysiological abnormalities were directly correlated with AHI and MSpO2.</p>
      <p>In our study, we found that the significant group effects of EMMN mean amplitudes, and post hoc analyses showed that the amplitudes of EMMN were significantly reduced in OSAS patients compared with healthy control, regardless of happy or sad condition. Since MMN could be elicited even in the absence of attention or behavioral response and reflect the capability of automatic processing of sensory information,<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> the aforementioned results suggested that patients with OSAS might suffer from pre-attentive emotional processing abnormalities. Furthermore, source localization analysis was performed by Kimura et al<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> further demonstrating that EMMN had its main generators in frontal, limbic, temporal and occipital lobes, and the activation of occipitotemporal lobe was observed in early EMMN, while frontal and limbic activations occurred in almost all stages of EMMN. Interestingly, Yaouhi et al confirmed gray matter loss in the temporo–parieto–occipital and frontal cortices using a high-resolution MRI scanning in OSAS patients.<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Recent study of cerebral functional imaging and damage showed that decreased brain gray matter volume with quantitative neuroimaging in OSAS patients.<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Thus, there is the possibility that alterations in corresponding brain regions might explain pre-attentive dysfunction of facial expressions, while the underlying neural mechanisms deserve further elucidation.</p>
      <p>Another key finding was that the mean amplitude of EMMN for sad facial expressions was significantly larger than that for happy facial expressions in the control group, implying that healthy people are more sensitive and able to process negative emotional information. In line with our findings, previous studies have shown that EMMN reflected pre-attentive change detection of facial emotion, with larger amplitude for negative facial expression than for positive one in controls.<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> In addition, a study proposed that people could process negative emotional information more quickly and efficiently.<xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> From an electrophysiological perspective, the abovementioned results supported the proposed theory of negative bias effect.</p>
      <p>In order to assess the relationships between EMMN amplitudes and clinical variables of OSAS sufferers, Pearson’s correlations were calculated. Almost no correlations were found between EMMN and Age, AI, MmSpO<sub>2</sub>%, but we discovered that there were positive correlations between EMMN amplitudes and BMI, ESS, AHI, and they were also negatively correlated with MSpO<sub>2</sub>, indicating that several clinical characteristics of OSAS patients could potentially modulate pre-attentive emotion processing abnormalities. Consistent with our results, some studies found that sleepiness cause attenuation amplitude of auditory MMN, these results could suggest that cognitive pre-attentive processing is impaired.<xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Furthermore, an interesting result is that the amplitude of EMMN was negatively correlated with MoCA score. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) covering various important domains of neurocognitive functions,<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> which was used to assess eight aspects of cognitive functions, these eight aspects were subdivided into 12 themes and 30 separate items. Although abovementioned brain function field could not enough to explain the cognitive impairment of automatic processing of emotional facial expressions under the pre-attentive condition in patients with OSAS, one possible explanation is that EMMN reflects mismatches between an infrequent facial expression and the memory of a frequent facial expression, and is likely to represent a wider range of neurocognitive associations.<xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Future research results may further promote understanding of the neuropsychological mechanism of emotion cognition and increase the brain’s understanding of this part of emotional facial expressions under the pre-attentive condition processing function.</p>
      <p>The main advantages of the present study are standardized subject selection criteria and collection of detailed OSAS characteristics. In addition, this is the first research to examine relations between expression-related MMN and OSAS by using expression-related oddball paradigm with high sensitivity. Previous findings have indicated that simple schematic faces might be beneficial to clinical research and application,<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> so multiple schematic facial models were used to avoid low-level processing of facial features and eliminate the possible influence of facial gender and race. It should be noted that this study has several limitations constraining explanation of our present findings. Firstly, the small sample size might have confined the study of the effects of gender, age and specific clinical characteristics, and the distinctions between the severity of OSAS among patients were not explored either. Larger cohorts should be increased to explore the differences of EMMN amplitude in mild, moderate and severe patients and regression analysis should be added to explore the influence of relevant factors on EMMN amplitude. Secondly, although schematic emotional faces were simple and reliable,<xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> real faces should also be used to further investigate this issue. Finally, source analysis was not conducted in this experiment, and we wish to work on it in future studies to reveal the underlying areas of network-level pathology.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Our study revealed pre-attentive processing of task-irrelevant emotional information was impaired in patients with OSAS, regardless of sad or happy facial expressions, meanwhile the negative bias effect was also not found, suggesting that the advantage of OSAS patients in automatic processing of sad expression was not obvious compared with that of happy expression. Notably, these electrophysiological parameters were negatively correlated with MSpO<sub>2</sub> and positive correlations with AHI, indicating the potential effect of some clinical characteristics of OSAS patients on automatic emotional processing. Considering the high prevalence and neurocognitive impairment of OSAS, EMMN might be used as a sensitive electrophysiological biomarker, while the reliability and efficacy demand further investigations.</p>
