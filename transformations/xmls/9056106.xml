          <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Sleep is an essential factor for athletes, and it is important to intervene in sleep to manage it. We need a device that can evaluate sleep easily and constantly. Consumer wearable devices can be useful tools for athletes. In order to use consumer wearable devices in clinical research, it is essential to conduct a validation study. Thus, we conducted a validation study to assess the Fitbit Alta HR</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><sup>TM</sup></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> (FBA)- a consumer wearable device with an accelerometer and a heart rate monitor to detect sleep stages and quality against electroencephalographic (EEG) studies in athletes.</citation_analysis></p>

        <sec id="s2003">
          <title>Results</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Regarding sleep parameters, there was a strong correlation between the total sleep time (TST)-EEG and the TST-Fitbit (r = 0.83; p &lt; 0.001). Regarding the sleep stages, there was a modest correlation between the N3 sleep-EEG and the N3 sleep-Fitbit (r = 0.68; p &lt; 0.001). In addition, there was a strong correlation between the percentage of N3 sleep in between sleep onset and initial rapid eye movement sleep-EEG and those on Fitbit (r = 0.73; p &lt; 0.001).</citation_analysis></p>

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Sleep plays an essential role in the physical and psychological recovery in athletes.

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">The gold standard for sleep assessment is polysomnography (PSG), which is difficult to perform in busy athletes. According to a review by Purvis et al, 20–60% of athletes suffer from stress due to excessive exercise and inadequate recovery.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> In this situation, it is difficult to find time to assess athletes’ sleep. Therefore, as an alternative to PSG, we measured athletes’ sleep quality using a two-channel portable electroencephalograph (EEG) device,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> which can be easily performed at home.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> However, the common problem with both PSG and EEG is that they cannot evaluate sleep continuously but only evaluate sleep quality over a limited period. These inspection methods may not be feasible for evaluating the sleep of athletes whose sleep environment changes during expeditions. Therefore, we focused on wearable technology that continuously monitors physical activity as a sleep evaluation device in athletes. We thought that Fitbit Alta HR</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><sup>TM</sup></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="negative"> (FBA; Fitbit, Inc.; San Francisco, CA, USA), which can evaluate sleep quality by combining acceleration measurement and heart rate variability (photoplethysmography-based heart rate sensors) with a unique algorithm, could be used as a sleep evaluation device.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Earlier generations of Fitbit models only detected body movements to determine sleep parameters. However, subsequently, by using photoplethysmography-based heart rate sensors to detect heart rate variability and body movements, recent Fitbit models can estimate sleep parameters and stages and heart rate while awake and sleeping.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> The Fitbit Charge 2</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><sup>TM</sup></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> uses a proprietary algorithm to combine speed measurements and heart rate variability in sleep assessment, which has been reported to detect sleep-wake states in healthy adults accurately, but with limited detection of N3 sleep.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> FBA is the successor to the Fitbit charge 2 </citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><sup>TM</sup></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> and is a downsized and minimized version of it. While the FBA has been reported to detect the sleep-wake state in healthy adults accurately,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> it has been reported to be insufficiently accurate in specific clinical populations</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive">. In particular, detecting sleep stages is different among the target populations, and no consistent results have been obtained.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11–15</xref></citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Based on these reports, we believe that it is essential to conduct validation studies to qualify Fitbit as a clinical device in general consumers. However, there are no reports that have validated FBA in athletes’ sleep evaluation. Furthermore, given the wide range of current consumer sleep tracking devices, rapid technological innovation, promising findings from recent performance studies, and the vital interest of athletes and leaders in the use of consumer sleep tracking devices, it is important to evaluate the effectiveness and reliability of FBA in determining athletes’ sleep parameters and stages. There is no debate that PSG is the gold standard for sleep testing, but it cannot be used for athletes’ actual day-to-day sleep management. Therefore, we are using EEG,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> validated in comparison with PSG as a substitute for PSG to manage and study sleep in athletes.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">However, although the device used is a two-channel portable EEG device and electroencephalography can be easily performed at home than PSG, it requires disposable electrodes and batteries, making each test costly. Furthermore, it is not possible to evaluate sleep simply by wearing the device without prior preparation such as FBA.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">We compared the degree to which sleep evaluation using a commercially available FBA was equivalent to that using a two-channel portable electroencephalograph and evaluated whether FBA would be useful as an alternative sleep testing device to a two-channel portable electroencephalograph.</citation_analysis></p>

The participants themselves set up the EEG monitoring at home. Sleep parameters obtained from this device were validated by PSG.

The sleep onset latency (SOL) was defined as the time between bedtime and sleep onset. Wake after sleep onset (WASO) was calculated as the total wakefulness time between the initial sleep onset and the final sleep offset. For sleep stages, the percentage of slow-wave sleep (ie, stage N3) per TST was assessed. Additionally, we assessed the percentage of N3 sleep during the interval from sleep onset to initial rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (ie, percentage of N3 sleep in initial non-REM sleep) because this is related to the secretion of growth hormone, which is essential for athletes.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Arousal index (ArI) was calculated as the number of microarousals per hour of sleep.</citation_analysis></p>

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">The present study provides novel insights into the clinical utility of FBA in determining the sleep parameter and stage in athletes.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="negative">We found a strong correlation between Fitbit and the EEG device in TST and between sleep onset and initial REM sleep, a moderate correlation in deep sleep, and a weak correlation in SOL and Arl. Fitbit tended to underestimate each item in the Bland-Altman plot, but the agreement was within the acceptable range. Proportional bias existed in all items except the TST, where the difference in N3 sleep parameters between FBA and simple EEG measurements increased as sleep improved. Regarding actual sleep management of athletes, it is more important to detect poor sleep as soon as possible rather than to judge the sleep quality. Additionally, the absolute values and the bias of the ArI are quite small and therefore not important in daily life. From this point of view, these biases are acceptable Nevertheless, caution should be raised when we see long SOL because the difference in SOL between the FBA and simple EEG measurements increased as these biases increased.</citation_analysis></p>

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">In this study, Fitbit showed an overall good correlation with TST, although it tended to underestimate to EEG in athletes. However, concerning SOL, there was a noticeable tendency to underestimate SOL compared with the EEG device when SOL-EEG was high. As mentioned above, the FBA’s algorithm for detecting when to start sleeping is undisclosed, but it is presumed to be a combination of heart rate detection using photoplethysmography-based heart rate sensors and body movement detection using an accelerometer. This trend most likely resulted from the detection algorithm. Fitbit may tend to underestimate SOL if the participant is trying to sleep, ie, taking a long time to fall asleep. Therefore, we need to pay attention to this aspect when conducting Fitbit’s sleep evaluations.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">In terms of sleep stages, it has been reported that most consumer devices tend to incorrectly recognize 30–50% of both N3 and REM sleep as light sleep,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> while the FBA has been reported to have the same specificity than PSG for epoch-by-epoch agreement.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> This study showed that FBA is as accurate as EEG in detecting N3 sleep in athletes.</citation_analysis></p>

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">In the future, sleep data obtained from Fitbit could be used to determine current fatigue and mental state, and the data obtained could be used to intervene in sleep to improve performance in athletes. Reportedly, by combining Fitbit data on steps (physical activity) and sleep (insomnia and hypersomnia) with smartphone usage, location information, and call records, the system detected post-semester depression in 138 college students with 85.7% accuracy as well as changes in symptoms with 85.4% accuracy.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Many people worldwide are now using Fitbit and other consumer wearable devices, large-scale data collection on an enterprise basis is possible, and the machines themselves are undergoing rapid technological innovations. The promising efficacy and usefulness of Fitbit, one of the consumer wearable devices in this study, is expected to become more accurate with further population evaluations and algorithm settings. Clinically, it may be possible to immediately detect individual sleep patterns and its sudden changes to predict sleep disorders and deteriorating health conditions that may require intervention.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">This study has several limitations. First, although the study was conducted on college athletes in the Department of Physical Education who had an almost uniform lifestyle, training schedule, and diet, it was an evaluation of sleep at a habitual time, and bedtime and time in bed were not strictly controlled. However, this limitation may also be an advantage, as the study evaluated whether FBA can be used in daily life.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Second, since there may be an inherent bias in the two-channel EEG used in the experiment itself and the sleep accuracy may be lower than PSG, it is necessary to discuss the accuracy compared to PSG. However, the purpose of this study is to investigate whether Fitbit Alta HR, with its convenience and developmental potential, can be used as an alternative testing device to EEG, which was validated in comparison with PSG. Third, in terms of sleep stages, comparisons were not made on an epoch-by-epoch basis but rather as a percentage of the total. Although it is possible to obtain raw data with the Fitbit API,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> it is not easy to accurately synchronize the time with the EEG epochs; therefore, epoch-by-epoch analysis could not be reliably performed with publicly available tools.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Forth, the Arl of Fitbit is the number of “awakenings” per hour of sleep, which is different from the original definition. This comparison was for reference only. Finally, only N3 sleep, which is important for athletes’ sleep, was evaluated.

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">FBA was shown to be as good as EEG in detecting N3 sleep, which is considered necessary in athletes’ sleep management. In particular, it is difficult for athletes to manage sleep conditions using PSG or EEG. The ability to evaluate sleep using a wearable device will enable sleep interventions to be tailored to the changing environment unique to athletes, which may ultimately lead to improved athletic performance.</citation_analysis></p>
