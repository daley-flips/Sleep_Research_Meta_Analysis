Most children had a normal body mass index (BMI). Sleepiness and BMI were associated with sleep schedules and food patterns, such that they accounted for 76% of variance, predominantly by the association of BMI with mean wake after sleep onset and by bedtime sleepiness, with wake after sleep onset variability. Similarly, 97% of variance was shared with eating behaviors, such as desserts and snacks, and fast food meals were associated with morning sleepiness.</citation_analysis></p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">The association between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and sleep was initially formulated in 1957,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-nss-4-009">1</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> and generated substantial debate, which persists until today. In the past, sleep problems were included among the diagnostic criteria for ADHD. However, while sleep issues have now been removed from the diagnostic criteria, the interdependencies of sleep and ADHD are currently perceived as highly complex phenomena that have not been adequately elucidated. Indeed, sleep quantity as well as quality may affect or be affected by such ADHD symptomatology, and indeed, complaints expressed by either child or caregiver, such as difficulty in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, and somnolence, are extremely frequent.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-nss-4-009">2</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">–</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-nss-4-009">5</xref></citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">ADHD symptoms are primarily treated with medication, ie, methylphenidate and amphetamines. Stimulants have been associated with either no changes or with increased sleep complaints in children with ADHD,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-nss-4-009">4</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> whereas treatment of underlying primary sleep disorders (ie, disordered breathing, periodic leg movement syndrome, and restless legs syndrome) have led to improved neurobehavioral functioning.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-nss-4-009">6</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> In fact, because sleep problems are likely to coexist,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-nss-4-009">7</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> both clinicians and researchers need to be very attentive to this overlap when facing ADHD symptomatology.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">ADHD comorbidity is frequent, with 59%–87% of children diagnosed with ADHD presenting at least one comorbidity, and 20% having three or more comorbid conditions or symptoms. The latter include learning disabilities (15%–25%), language disorders (30%–35%), social adaptive dysfunction (eg, 10% autistic spectrum disorders), emotional lability (eg, 15%–20% mood disorder, 20%–25% anxiety disorder), motor coordination and balance deficits (60%),</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-nss-4-009">8</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> obesity,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-nss-4-009">9</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-nss-4-009">10</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> and sleep problems.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-nss-4-009">11</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-nss-4-009">12</xref></citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="negative">The issue of obesity and ADHD has recently gained attention, whereby children with ADHD appear to be at increased risk for obesity.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-nss-4-009">10</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-nss-4-009">13</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">–</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-nss-4-009">16</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Although the increased prevalence of both obesity and ADHD are indisputable, these two conditions also share the frequent presence of excessive daytime sleepiness. Sleepiness may result from erratic highly variable sleep-wake patterns, as well as from sleep disorders. For instance, fragmented sleep, which is characteristic of children with sleep-disordered breathing, leads to altered behavior patterns that promote obesity, ie, eating less healthy food, and reducing the likelihood of engaging in organized sports.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-nss-4-009">17</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Furthermore, the hypoarousal state that is present in both obese children and ADHD children may predispose them towards “hyperstimulatory behaviors” in the form of nutritional or sensory content (eg, television watching, excessive eating).</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-nss-4-009">13</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="negative"> Night-to-night variability in the sleep patterns of children with ADHD</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-nss-4-009">18</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> has been suggested as a potential mediator of ADHD-associated symptomatology, and partial sleep deprivation could also exacerbate or contribute to both sleepiness and behaviors.

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">This study was approved by the University of Illinois at Chicago human research committee, and informed consent was obtained from the legal caregiver of each participant, with assent being obtained from children older than 7 years of age (University of Illinois at Chicago approval number 2009-0397). During the period from June 10 to August 22, 2010, 34 children aged 6–13 years were enrolled in the Camp Star summer treatment program</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-nss-4-009">20</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-nss-4-009">21</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> and 24 consented to participate in the current study. Camp Star program is an intensive program for school-aged children with ADHD and associated social and behavioral difficulties. It offers these children with psychopathological disorders in excess of 280 hours of behavioral and social therapy over a 6-week span. The program combines a token economy behavior modification point system, daily report cards and timeout procedures with academic remediation, problem-solving and social skill training, sports skill training, and preparation in coping with frustration. This is accomplished through a 1:2 child to counselor ratio. Parents can join weekly training sessions in parenting skills specific to children with ADHD and comorbidities. The parentally reported diagnoses were confirmed by the Camp Star professional team. Exclusion criteria assessed during the screening process were cognitive impairment (intelligent quotient &lt;55) and children with severe aggressive or violent behaviors. A clinical description of the sample prior to Camp Star involves the Conner’s Parent Rating Scale Global Index Total of 70.43 ± 10.02, pretreatment Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) total score of 72.71 ± 9.55, Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale of 1.27 ± 0.47, Social Responsiveness Scale of 70.69 ± 11.36. The diagnostic inclusion criterion for the sleep study was being a camper at the summer treatment program under the supervision of the clinical director. Participation in the sleep study was voluntary. The pilot data were collected during the mid-camp phase, and no sleep training was provided. Camp started at 8:30 am and ended at 4:00 pm.</citation_analysis></p>

A concomittant sleep log was provided to the parent to mark bedtime/risetime, awakenings, and other night-time events. In addition, several questionnaires were used; on the one hand, such a multimethod and multitrait approach gives a more complete perspective of the sleep complaints, and on the other hand, this was applied because a lack of good sleep tools exists.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-nss-4-009">24</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-nss-4-009">25</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> As a result, self-reported sleepiness at bedtime, at the start of the camp day (8:30 am) and at the end of each day (3:40 pm) was collected from each child using the pictorial sleepiness scale.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-nss-4-009">26</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> The pictorial sleepiness scale avoids semantic or geometric elements by using a Thurstone scaling procedure to transform rankings of 5 faces, ie, minimum (0) and maximum (5.58).

The CSHS has an internal consistency of 0.76. The Bedtime Routines Questionnaire (BRQ) is a 31-item paper-and-pencil five-point Likert type, parent-report measure of children’s bedtime routines which has demonstrated a solid factor structure, adequate internal consistency, and fair validity coefficients in 2–8-year-old children.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-nss-4-009">33</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> The Pediatric Food Frequency and Physical Activity Questionnaire</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-nss-4-009">17</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> allows for screening of overall eating and drinking patterns encompassing a one-week timeframe.

        <title>Statistical analysis</title>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Statistical analyses were performed using Statistica version 9.0. (StatSoft Inc, Tulsa, OK). Sleep complaints reported by child and caregiver were recorded (often, sometimes and never a problem) and only sleep complaints with a &gt;30% endorsement rate for “sometimes” or “often” are reported. Descriptive and correlational analyses will be presented whilst predictors of sleep schedules were analysed via regression analyses (standardized betas are printed). To assess the association between sleepiness and BMI on the one hand with the sleep, sleep hygiene and routine, as well as food patterns on the other, canonical correlation analyses were performed. This statistical technique needs to be interpreted as “multiple multiple” correlations whereby sets of variables are associated. Their association is commonly expressed in terms of shared variance, and can be detailed by the individual correlations (moderate correlations and above are reported).</citation_analysis></p>

Two Actiwatch recordings were corrupted, two Actiwatches were damaged, and two children discontinued wearing the watch. All children were taking one or multiple medications, ie, 50% stimulants, 28.6% stimulants combined with antihypertensive drugs, 14.3% mood stabilizers or antidepressants, and 7.1% other nonstimulant medication. Categorized on parent-reported diagnosis, the group comprised seven ADHD, eight ADHD with comorbidity, and three children with cognitive disorders not otherwise specified, nonverbal learning disability, and autism.

        <title>Sleep schedules</title>

On average, the children were awake for about 2 hours per night, with a variability of one hour. Sleep patterns showed 33% restlessness (ie, the sum of the percentage mobile and the percentage immobile bouts of &lt;one minute in duration to the number of immobility bouts for the given interval), with no differences between weekdays and weekend. These were “typical” nights as reported by 66.7% of the parents. Because the cohort was a heterogeneous group, we performed secondary analyses to explore the variance in sleep schedules (</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-nss-4-009">Figure 2</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">). A proportion of total variance in the sleep schedule parameters was due to differences between the children (</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-nss-4-009">Figure 2</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive">, shown in black), yet no variation could be ascribed to the diagnostic category.

About 40% of the variance in wakeup time, time in bed, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset (WASO), and wake after sleep end was ascribable to differences between children, but could also be ascribed to daily differences within each child (</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-nss-4-009">Figure 2</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive">, shown in grey).

Self-reported sleepiness at bedtime varied in nearly equal amounts between children (54.1% variance) as within any given child per day (variance 45.2%, variance ascribed to day 0.7%). However, more daily variation was seen within each child in the morning (64% variance) and the evening (65.6% variance), which concurs with the hypoarousal hypothesis (ie, the remaining percentage of variance can be attributed to the child). Average sleepiness at 8:30 am was 1.56 ± 1.1 and at 3:40 pm was 1.81 ± 1.35.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">This study provides preliminary evidence that even if children with psychopathology are of normal weight, their disrupted sleep and sleepiness appears to favor unhealthy food consumption patterns. Therefore, daytime somnolence may place children with ADHD at increased risk for obesity. These findings extend those published in the literature by providing further evidence on the night-to-night sleep variability and day-to-day hypoarousal state of children with ADHD and comorbidities.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Before discussing our findings in greater detail, we would like to address some methodological limitations. This study comprises only a small and heterogeneous group of children with psychopathological problems in terms of diagnosis and medical treatment, and its results should therefore be interpreted as pilot indicators. Even though recordings of sleep were performed during the summer break, the start and end times in camp were designed to mimic school schedules. At this stage, we were unable to include a control group, but comparisons of questionnaire scores with similar samples obtained in other cohorts are suggestive of a typical sample of children with primarily ADHD and comorbidities. This is also corroborated by the sleep complaints and sleep pattern findings. However, we have no baseline measurements, and parents and children were highly motivated and the only source of information, such that longer and/or repeated recording periods might have been advisable.</citation_analysis></p>

Alternatively, we have previously shown that in typically developing children, the combination of shorter sleep duration and more variable sleep patterns was associated with increased obesity risk.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-nss-4-009">19</xref></citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Our multiple sleepiness assessments support the suggestion of disturbed biorhythms, because findings based on self-report at bedtime and at 8:30 am and 3:40 pm on a camp day indicated that these children were somnolent. More specifically, a substantial day-to-day variability was found within each child, irrespective of diagnosis. Variable sleep has been hypothesized to be a potential mediator that plays a role in eliciting ADHD-like phenotypes, and potentially contributes to or exacerbates their state. In our sample, bedtime across seven recording days showed a variability of nearly 2 hours, independent of day of the week, while only wakeup time was affected by day of the week. Indeed, our results further corroborate the hypothesized night-to-night variability; ie, across 5 days of monitoring sleep onset latency, total sleep time and time in bed were found to vary more in children with ADHD when compared with a control group.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-nss-4-009">18</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Gruber et al</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-nss-4-009">18</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> also found that children with ADHD slept on average 8 hours per night, as measured by actigraphy. Our sample slept on average for 7 hours and spent about 2 hours awake per night, indicating a substantial reduction in sleep efficiency. Also, sleep duration and wake after sleep onset varied within one hour during the period of our recordings. Sleep onset latency was about 30 minutes, with a variability of approximately 20 minutes, and not surprisingly, such findings are corroborated by the prevalence of subjective complaints on difficulties in falling asleep by both child and caregiver. Reduced sleep quantity and more disrupted sleep, as well as reduced sleep quality, have been commonly found and behavioral management strategies or pharmacological treatments have been suggested.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-nss-4-009">5</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-nss-4-009">38</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-nss-4-009">39</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> In practice, good physiological and environmental hygiene might reduce such complaints, and likewise, adaptive activities and explicit routines favorably impacted the time spent in bed, and hence the sleep of children with psychopathologies. In other words, our findings indicate a need for good sleep-wake rhythmicity in children with ADHD and comorbid disorders. Although counterintuitive, several hypotheses with respect to the association of ADHD and obesity have been disputed.

Indeed, disrupted sleep (ie, mean wake after sleep onset and its variability, respectively) was associated with the child’s weight and bedtime sleepiness. Associations between food consumption preferences and morning sleepiness emerged as well.
