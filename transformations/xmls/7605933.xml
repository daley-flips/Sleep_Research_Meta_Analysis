          <title>Background</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Sleep affects a wide array of health outcomes and is associated with the quality of life. Among students, sleep quality is affected by school stage and grade; however, data regarding the different sleep-related problems students experience at different school stages are limited. In this study, we aimed to explore sleep quality among a student sample ranging from elementary school to university level.</citation_analysis></p>

        <sec id="s2002">
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Overall, data were examined for 9392 subjects aged 9–22 years. Information on sociodemographic characteristics and other variables were collected through self-administered questionnaires. Sleep quality on school nights was evaluated using the standard Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; global score &gt;5 was classified as poor sleep quality. For the high school sample, logistic regression analysis was used to estimate associations between sleep quality and certain factors.</citation_analysis></p>

          <title>Results</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Of the elementary school, middle school, vocational high school, senior high school, and university students, 7.5%, 19.2%, 28.6%, 41.9%, and 28.5%, respectively, showed poor sleep quality. The high school students reported the highest prevalence of shorter sleep duration (70.8%), day dysfunction (84.7%), and subjective poor sleep quality (17.2%). The elementary school students showed the highest prevalence of poor sleep efficiency (17.9%). The university students showed the highest prevalence of sleep medication use (6.4%). The vocational high school students reported the highest prevalence of sleep latency (6.3%) and sleep disturbance (7.4%). Logistic regression modeling indicated that sleep quality is positively associated with school stage, grade, family atmosphere, academic pressure, and number of friends.</citation_analysis></p>

          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Sleep quality and sleep features change greatly from elementary school to university. Interventions to improve sleep quality should consider targeting the specific issues students experience at each school stage. Alarmed by the high prevalence of poor sleep quality among high school students, it is recommended that high school students should be informed of their sleep matter and the consequences.</citation_analysis></p>

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Sleep quality has implications for psychosocial, behavioral, and health issues, as well as health-related quality of life; thus, it represents a major public health concern. As an indispensable component of life, sleep plays a major role in health and growth; many significant physiological functions and brain activities occur during sleep, such as the relieving of fatigue and brain development in early childhood.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Suboptimal sleep quality is associated with a wide range of diseases and adverse health outcomes, both physical and mental.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">–</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></citation_analysis></p>

The entire school period (ranging from elementary school to university) represents a critical stage of human life and plays a very important role in students’ physiological development and the establishment of values and self-cognition. However, this is also a period of vulnerability that can be accompanied by emotional and behavioral distress. During all of these school stages, students experience continuous changes in their physical functions, psychology, behaviors, cognition, and learning objectives, all of which have a substantial effect on their sleep quality. The effects of sleep problems on students have been widely reported. Unhealthy sleep patterns and sleep disturbances are common across students from a wide range of areas and cultures and are associated with a host of mental, physical, cognitive, and academic consequences.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">–</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="negative"> Insufficient sleep is highly prevalent among elementary school students and, for these students, is associated with an increased risk of obesity, behavioral problems, and poor academic performance.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Despite this, many studies have reported that adolescent students experience a higher incidence of sleep problems and shorter sleep durations.

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Given the high prevalence and heavy burden of poor sleep quality among students, identifying potentially modifiable factors so that can be targeted for the prevention or amelioration of sleep problems is an important research aim. Although the topic of students’ sleep (or, at least, some aspects of it) is advancing at the international level, the effect of school stages (and related factors) on sleep has not been thoroughly analyzed. It is necessary to investigate sleep status at different school levels and to develop appropriate intervention methods (tailored to suit each school stage) to help students address sleep problems. Given that sleep quality and sleep problems vary greatly depending on age and population,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> and that following a large group of students over this long development period would present notable challenges, the central analyses of research into this topic should focused on comparing students at each of the five stages of schooling (elementary school, middle school, high school, vocational high school, and university), while sleep quality and factors related needs to be explored. In the present study, we explored sleep among a student sample ranging from elementary school to university, and this research represents one of the most extensive studies to examine the sleep quality of Chinese students. Such descriptive baseline data can obtain an objective perspective of the potential differences in the sleep patterns of students at different school stages, and provide evidence that can inform future efforts to improve the sleep status of students at each of these school stages.</citation_analysis></p>

        <title>The Survey</title>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Data were collected from a cross-sectional questionnaire survey that was conducted from September to December 2018 in Heilongjiang Province, China, by the Heilongjiang Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. The survey aimed to monitor the prevalence of student behaviors that influence health. The questionnaire was reviewed and checked by a panel of public health experts and was revised after a pilot survey. The survey featured a series of items relating to habits, behaviors, cognition, and emotions. In the current study, responses to items regarding the quality of sleep and its related variables were explored.</citation_analysis></p>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">A multi-stage cluster sampling method was adopted. Finally, four elementary schools, four middle schools, three high schools, one vocational high school and one university were randomly selected within each city (Harbin, Jiamusi, and Jixi) of Heilongjiang Province. A total of 9396 students participated in the survey; four questionnaires were discarded because important information was missing, resulting in a total of 9392 valid survey responses. The final sample comprised 2912 elementary school students from grades 4, 5 and 6, respectively; 2878 middle school students from grades 1, 2 and 3, respectively; 2160 high school students from grades 1, 2 and 3, respectively; 720 vocational high school students from grades 1, 2, 3, respectively, and 722 college students from grades 1, 2 and 3, respectively. For each grade analyzed, identical numbers of classes were sampled from each participating school. </citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table

        <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Across all school stages, elementary school students showed the lowest prevalence of poor sleep quality (7.5%). In this study, the average sleep duration (for elementary school grades 4, 5, and 6) on weekdays was 9.03 hours, which is longer than those reported in previous studies conducted in Japanese (8.57 hours for grade 4; 8.30 hours for grade 5; and 8.08 hours for grade 6) and Korean (overall average: 8.18 hours).</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> In the present sample, the most prominent sleep problem among elementary students was low sleep efficiency.</citation_analysis></p>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Middle school and high school are critical transitional stages characterized by a plethora of physical, psychological, and cognitive changes.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> It has long been the case that Asian adolescents, including those in China, receive relatively large amounts of homework and spend longer periods of time learning than their American and European peers. They go to bed later than North American adolescents and obtain less sleep than European samples, partly as a result of their rigid school schedules and intense academic and social demands; they also tend to report higher rates of daytime sleepiness.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> When students enter the middle school stage, they are in the midst of a series of changes. The onset of puberty coincides with increased expectations regarding academic performance and a desire for independence from parents and teachers, all of which can create challenges. In addition, Chinese middle school students spend a considerable amount of time on academic works in order to prepare for their forthcoming high school entrance examination, because they believe that entering a high-quality high school can double their chances of entering a high-level university.</citation_analysis></p>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Among the five school stages, high school students showed the highest prevalence of poor sleep quality (41.9%) and poor subjective sleep quality (17.2%), and reported extremely high rates of short sleep duration (70.8%) and day dysfunction (84.7%). Notably, the sleep problems of high school students are much more serious than those of vocational high school students. In China, high school and vocational high school are all the next school stage (high school stage) after middle school stage, but their school types and learning tasks are extraordinarily different. Most vocational high school students begin working immediately after graduation; however, high school students’ main objective is to enter a competitive university and pursue further study. In this study, the age structures of the high school (16.08 ± 1.03) and vocational high school (16.48 ± 1.13) students were similar; however, their sleep patterns varied greatly as a result of the different educational pressures and academic burdens they experienced. It is not unusual for high school students to spend long periods studying to gain entry to China’s extremely competitive university system.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> In this study, the prevalence of poor sleep quality among the vocational high school students was much lower than that of the high school students, but the vocational high school students reported the highest prevalence of long sleep latency and disturbance, and the second-highest prevalence of daytime dysfunction. This may be related to the lower academic pressure and the higher proportion of accommodation (52.2% for vocational high school students and 22.5% for high school students, data are not showed in the Table) of vocational high school students, which create a lack of parental supervision, and also allows vocational high school students more time to use screens before falling asleep. Indeed, just 8.9% of the vocational college students reported perceiving a high level of academic pressure; slightly higher than the elementary school students (7.95%); however, the proportion of high school students who perceived a high level of academic pressure was 23.2%. Widespread reports of sleep deprivation among adolescents have resulted in an increased focus on the general sleep problems experienced by high school students. Insufficient sleep is especially problematic for high school students who place a heavy emphasis on academic achievement,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> as students and their parents generally believe that it is worthwhile to curtail sleep in order to pursue better academic-performance objectives. Their rigid school schedules and intense academic and social demands exacerbate existing sleep problems, and many of these problems tend to increase across high school years.</citation_analysis></p>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">In our sample, the prevalence of poor sleep quality increased as the school stage increased, reaching the highest level in high school (41.9%) and vocational high school (28.6%); however, it then declined in the university stage (28.5%), where academic pressure is relatively lower. Despite this, sleep problems in college cannot be ignored. The numerous health and academic-related consequences of sleep problems make sleep, particularly during emerging adulthood, a public health concern.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> College students experience unique challenges at the beginning of campus life (eg experiencing an unfamiliar environment, being responsible for oneself for the first time, academic stress, and living in a dormitory with students from different regions and cultures), all of which influence, or even heavily change, their sleep styles and sleep quality.

Peers are an important part of students’ social lives; high school students’ academic and extra-curricular activities frequently involve interactions with other teenagers, meaning peer relationships are ubiquitous. Positive peer relationships may contribute to better sleep, as students with such good relationships may be less likely to experience arousal, pain, or concerns that may interfere with sleep.

There was no significant difference in this regard between the 1st and 2nd-grade high school students, but the 3rd-grade students were significantly more likely to report poor sleep quality than were the 1st-grade students. This phenomenon could be related to the fact that the 3rd-grade students spend most of their final high school year preparing for China’s strict National College Entrance Exam.

This study examined sleep quality in students of northeast China. Due to different ages, physical and mental development and academic performance expectations, we found that sleep characteristics differed among students from elementary school to university, this may suggest that the stages of school and the deeper implications associated with it may play important roles in determining whether adolescents can achieve quality sleep.

Second, in addition to the factors found in this study, sleep quality may also be affected by many other complex factors, such as the use of electronic light-emitting products before sleep. Third, adopting 7 hours as the cutoff for the best sleep duration may underestimate the proportion of poor sleep quality for the elementary school sample. Indeed, sleep patterns, including appropriate sleep durations, change throughout life, and are influenced by age and various other factors.

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Among students, sleep patterns from childhood to early adulthood are related not only to chronologic age but also to school stage. We found that school stage may play an important role in determining whether students secure high-quality sleep. Differences in sleep duration, variability, and patterns exist within school stages. In addition, the high prevalence of poor sleep quality among high school students indicates that high school students should urgently be informed of the importance of adequate sleep and the consequences of inadequate sleep.</citation_analysis></p>
