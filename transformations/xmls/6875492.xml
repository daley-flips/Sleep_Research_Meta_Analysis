          <title>Purpose</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Recent studies demonstrate that 5-Hz bilateral transcranial alternating current stimulation (θ-tACS) on fronto-temporal areas affects resting EEG enhancing cortical synchronization, but it does not affect subjective sleepiness. This dissociation raises questions on the resemblance of this effect to the physiological falling asleep process. The current study aimed to evaluate the ability of fronto-temporal θ-tACS to promote sleep.</citation_analysis></p>

          <title>Subjects and methods</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Twenty subjects (10 F/10 M; mean age: 24.60 ± 2.9 y) participated in a single-blind study consisting of two within-subject sessions (active/sham), one week apart in counterbalanced order. Stimulation effects on EEG were assessed during wake and post-stimulation nap. The final sample included participants who fell asleep in both sessions (n=17).</citation_analysis></p>

        <sec id="S2003">
          <title>Results</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Group analyses on the whole sample reported no θ-tACS effects on subjective sleepiness and sleep measures, while a different scenario came to light by analysing data of responders to the stimulation (ie, subjects actually showing the expected increase of theta activity in the wake EEG after the θ-tACS, n=7). Responders reported a significant increase in subjective sleepiness during wakefulness after the active stimulation as compared to the sham. Moreover, the sleep after the θ-tACS compared to sham in this sub-group showed: (1) greater slow-wave activity (SWA); (2) SWA time-course revealing increases much larger as closer to the sleep onset; (3) stimulation-induced changes in SWA during sleep topographically associated to those in theta activity during wake.</citation_analysis></p>

        <sec id="S2004">
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Subjects who show the expected changes during wake after the stimulation also had a consistent pattern of changes during sleep. The enhancement of cortical synchronization by θ-tACS during wakefulness actually corresponds to increased sleep pressure, but it occurs only in some individuals. Thus, θ-tACS can enhance sleep, although individual factors to be further investigated affect the actual responsiveness to this treatment.</citation_analysis></p>

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">In one recent study, however, we used bilateral transcranial alternating current stimulation at 5 Hz (θ-tACS) on fronto-temporal areas.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> This stimulation induced significant increases, compared to the sham condition, of (A) the theta activity in temporo-parieto-occipital areas and (B) the alpha activity in centro-frontal areas.

Therefore, θ-tACS modulated the theta and alpha EEG activity with a topography consistent with high sleep pressure, without affecting subjectively perceived sleepiness.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">This dissociation between objective and subjective measures of sleep propensity raises a fundamental question regarding the nature of induced effects. In our opinion, there are two possible interpretations: (1) the modulation of resting EEG frequency is a form of temporary entrainment of specific rhythms, which does not directly affect sleep pressure; (2) these EEG changes are associated to a manipulation of sleep pressure, which is not necessarily paralleled by changes of subjective sleepiness.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">With the aim of evaluating these two hypotheses, we replicated the θ-tACS protocol on fronto-temporal areas and directly assessed its ability to modulate the sleep pressure by asking the participants to have a nap at the end of the stimulation period (the protocol of the experiment is illustrated in </citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">). Therefore, the primary goal and dependent measures were not the resting EEG rhythms, but the macro- (ie, sleep latency and amount of NREM sleep) and microstructural measures of sleep architecture (ie, EEG topography of NREM sleep). If the modulation of wake EEG activity in the direction of slower EEG frequency actually reflects an increase of sleep pressure, we would observe shorter sleep latency, longer time spent in slow-wave sleep, and an increased amount of SWA.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><fig id="F0001" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Experimental design.

        <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Twenty healthy subjects (10 males and 10 females; mean age 24.6 ± 2.9 years) participated in the study after providing written informed consent. All participants were medication-free. The exclusion criteria, assessed by a clinical interview, were: presence or history of neurological or psychiatric disorder, epilepsy, sleep disorders and the presence of intracranial metal implants. As a further criterion, subjects were selected on the basis of their habit to have a diurnal nap. Due to the failure of three subjects to fall asleep, the final sample consisted of 17 subjects (9 males and 8 females; mean age 24.3 ± 3.1 years).</citation_analysis></p>

        <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">The protocol involved two experimental sessions at 1-week distance: a real stimulation condition (θ-tACS) and a sham condition.

The arrival at the laboratory was scheduled at 12:00 hrs. The lunch took place at 12:30 hrs and then we proceeded with the montage of EEG and stimulation electrodes. The experimental session started at 14:00 hrs with the assessment of the self-reported measure of sleepiness. The EEG signals were acquired in an electrically shielded, soundproof, and a temperature-controlled room with constant dim light.</citation_analysis></p>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Five minutes of a resting eyes-closed EEG was recorded as a baseline. The stimulation (θ-tACS or sham) was then applied for 10 mins. During the stimulation, participants had to keep their eyes closed. Post-stimulation EEG (5 mins) was recorded as close to the end of the stimulation as possible, followed by the post-stimulation sleepiness measurement. Then, the stimulation electrodes were removed, and the subjects were asked to have a nap. Subjects had a maximum of 1 hr to fall asleep. Subjects were allowed to sleep for a maximum of 2 hrs, starting from the sleep onset, but they could get out of bed earlier if they woke up and felt could no longer sleep. The sleep onset was identified by a sleep scoring expert, who continuously monitored the EEG recordings, and it was defined by the first appearance of a K-complex or a sleep spindle lasting more than 0.5 s, as the most reliable boundary between wakefulness and sleep.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></citation_analysis></p>

The ground electrode was placed at Fpz and the cortical EEG signals were referenced online to the averaged mastoids (A1 and A2). The electro-oculograms (EOGs) and the submental electromyograms (EMG) were also recorded for the offline artifacts detection and sleep scoring. Electrodes resistance was kept below 5 kΩ. BrainAmp MR plus system (Brain Products GmbH, Gilching) and Brain Vision Recorder (Version 1.10, Brain Products GmbH, Gilching) software were used to amplify and record the signals.

In θ-tACS condition, participants underwent to 10 min with a sinusoidal alternating current with 5-Hz frequency (maximum current intensity: 0.6 mA) with 10 s ramp in/out. An identical stimulation setting was adopted in the sham condition, but the stimulator was turned off after 10 s (ie, to induce the same short-lasting tingling sensation that subjects usually refer at the beginning of the stimulation procedure). None of the participants reported phosphenes sensations or adverse effects of the stimulations, but a weak and short-lasting sensation of tingling in the skin under the stimulation electrodes. A post-experiment debriefing verified that participants had noticed no differences among the active and sham condition. The two stimulation electrodes were removed before the start of the nap.</citation_analysis></p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">The aim of our study was a direct evaluation of the ability of a tACS protocol to affect sleep pressure, after our recent demonstration that a 5-Hz tACS stimulation affects resting EEG by enhancing cortical EEG synchronization compared to a sham stimulation.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Those findings also suggested that the effect of θ-tACS relays not only on the simple entrainment of cortical oscillations at the stimulation frequency, but it also induces a global and physiological synchronizing effect, affecting both the theta and alpha frequency ranges. Here, we have not been able to show any group effect on polysomnographic nor on topographic quantitative EEG measures. Sleep immediately following sham or active θ-tACS did not change in any aspect during the first sleep cycle when comparing sham vs active conditions. However, when we replicated the analyses focusing on the responders to the stimulation only, ie, those subjects who actually had the increase of the theta activity during wake after θ-tACS, as a marker of enhanced sleep pressure, the pattern of the results changed. These responders actually show clear effects on their sleep as a consequence of θ-tACS. After the active stimulation, compared to the sham, responders had: (1) an enhancement of sleep pressure as indicated by higher SWA; (2) a time course of the SWA revealing an increase much larger as closer to the sleep onset (ie, closer to the presleep stimulation), which progressively decrease across the first sleep cycle; and (3) a topographically specific correlation between changes of the theta activity during wake and corresponding changes of SWA during sleep. All these effects go in the direction of an increased sleep pressure, directly related to the previous increase of the theta activity as a consequence of θ-tACS. Hence, the more the subjects show the expected changes after the stimulation during wake, the more they also express a consistent pattern of changes during sleep.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">According to the main aim of our study of responding to the fundamental question regarding the nature of the effects induced by θ-tACS during wakefulness,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> current results indicate that waking EEG changes, when present, are actually associated with an increase in sleep pressure. Unavoidably, the subsequent question becomes what differentiates responders from non-responders. Baseline resting EEG does not point to any significant difference between responders vs non-responders, at least with the type of standard analysis as adopted in the present study. We only observed a non-significant trend of higher alpha activity over the left centro-parietal sites in responders compared to non-responders. High alpha activity at rest could be interpreted both as a state or a trait factor predisposing to react to the subsequent transcranial stimulation. In other words, a higher alpha activity could indicate a more relaxed state (ie, state) or a basic individual factor (ie, trait) that facilitate the effects of θ-tACS. However, the lack of significance in the differences between groups does not allow to make other considerations on this regard.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">This scenario questions that transcranial stimulations could be proposed at this stage as a method or, possibly, a treatment to promote physiological sleep. Actually, the small number of responders in our experimental sample raises some doubts on the generalizability of the results, which should be replicated in future studies with a larger sample size. On the other hand, the failure in identifying stable traits in baseline EEG differentiating responders from non-responders does not allow to design future studies specifically aimed to directly re-test the efficacy of the protocol in a sample selected ad-hoc as responders to the treatment. Indeed, it should be highlighted that the post-hoc selection of our responders in the present study can be considered as one of the main limits. Accordingly, future studies should also focus on the factors that modulate the presence/absence of coherent responses to θ-tACS. In our opinion, special attention should be devoted to the individual vulnerability to sleep deprivation. Phenotypic vulnerability to the effects of sleep loss has been explained by numerous (genetic, neurochemical, physiological, psychological or structural) factors, although none of these factors fully accounts for this phenomenon (for a comprehensive review, see</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive">). We can speculate that individual responsiveness to transcranial stimulation affecting sleepiness may depend on individual vulnerability to sleep deprivation. In other words, people less vulnerable to sleep loss could also be less responsive to transcranial stimulation. This speculation is indeed testable by investigating the effects of θ-tACS in groups with different vulnerability to sleep loss, as defined on the basis of cognitive performance and subjective reports.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Finally, attention should be also devoted to an individual characterization of the dynamic connectivity of brain regions across the wake–sleep transition, focusing on an optimal balance between local specialization (segregation) and global integration.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> In fact, we have recently described (by group analyses) how sleep onset is characterized by stronger connectivity in the sigma band paralleled by decreased connectivity in the low-frequency bands (ie, delta and theta activity).</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> In such a way, timing and topography of the specific mechanisms for the maintenance of functional connectivity may potentially discriminate individual responding and not responding with an EEG synchronization to transcranial stimulation.</citation_analysis></p>
