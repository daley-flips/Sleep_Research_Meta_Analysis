          <title>Purpose</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Wrist-worn actigraphy via research-grade devices, a well-established approach to the assessment of rest-activity, is limited by poor compliance, battery life, and lack of direct evidence for time spent physically in the bed. A non-invasive bed sensor (Emfit) may provide advantages over actigraphy for long-term sleep assessment in the home. This study compared sleep-wake measurements between this sensor and a validated actigraph.</citation_analysis></p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="s2002">
          <title>Patients and Methods</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Thirty healthy subjects (6 to 54 years) underwent simultaneous monitoring with both devices for 14 days and filled out a daily sleep diary. Parameters included bed entry time, sleep start, sleep end, bed exit time, rest interval duration, and wake after sleep onset (WASO). The agreement between the two devices was measured using Bland–Altman plots and inter-class correlation coefficients (ICC). In addition, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were obtained from epoch-by-epoch comparisons of Emfit and actigraphy.</citation_analysis></p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="s2003">
          <title>Results</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Fifteen percent of the subjects reported that wearing the actigraph was a burden. None reported that using the bed sensor was a burden. The minimal detectable change between Emfit and actigraphy was 11 minutes for bed entry time, 14 minutes for sleep start, 14 minutes for sleep end, 10 minutes for bed exit time, 20 minutes for rest interval duration, and 110 minutes for WASO. Inter-class correlation coefficients revealed an excellent agreement for all sleep parameters (ICC=0.99, 95% CI 98–99) except for WASO (ICC=0.46, 95% CI 0.33–0.56). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 0.62, 0.93, and 0.88, respectively. Kappa correlation analysis revealed a moderate correlation between the two devices (κ=0.55, p&lt;0.0001).</citation_analysis></p>

        <sec id="s2004">
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Emfit is an acceptable alternative to actigraphy for the estimation of bed entry time, sleep start, sleep end, bed exit time, and rest interval duration. However, WASO estimates are poorly correlated between the two devices. Emfit may offer methodological advantages in situations where actigraphy is challenging to implement.</citation_analysis></p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="negative">The assessment of sleep-wake patterns across days is an essential component of sleep medicine in clinical and research settings. The gold standard measurement of sleep is the polysomnogram (PSG). However, PSG is an invasive, expensive procedure limited to a single or few nights and unable to be routinely performed in specific populations (eg, infants, nursing home residents) or large cohort studies.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Actigraphy provides a low-cost, objective method to assess sleep used in both clinical and research settings. A growing number of studies have demonstrated the validity of actigraphy in distinguishing between sleep and wakefulness and providing reliable measures of sleep-wake organization and sleep quality, both in adults and children.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">However, although actigraphy devices are minimally invasive, studies using actigraphy have reported high rates of non-compliance as subjects do not wear the sensors or forget to press the event button to indicate bed entry and exit times.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3–5</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> For that reason, actigraphy is often used in combination with daily sleep diaries completed by subjects or their caretakers. Studies have reported high levels of agreement for sleep start and end times between actigraphy and sleep diaries.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> However, in some instances, sleep diaries can be fraught with reporter bias or pose a significant burden to subjects. Discrepancies between actigraphy and sleep diaries are found in populations with memory problems, such as the elderly or those with cognitive impairment.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Also, subjects with mood disorders can have a distorted perception of time, leading to over or under-reporting total sleep duration.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Last, in specific populations such as children, there are significant differences between sleep estimates obtained by actigraphy and diaries filled by caregivers.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Furthermore, most actigraphy devices have limited battery life and require recharging during studies longer than 1–4 weeks in duration. These limitations have restricted our understanding of the role of sleep both in health and disease.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">For those reasons, a non-invasive, objective measurement of sleep that can be used for prolonged periods, with little burden to the subject or caregiver, is needed. Pressure sensors located under a standard bed mattress utilize highly sensitive plethysmography to assess presence and movement in the bed. They provide an objective assessment of time in and out of bed and are non-invasive. Some bed sensors have the added ability to detect and record other physiological signals, such as heart rate and respiratory rate. However, the reliability of these measurements has yet to be validated. Bed sensors do not depend on battery power and can theoretically be used as long as the subject has access to electricity in the home. More importantly, they do not require subjects to wear a device, increasing adherence to the protocol. These benefits over actigraphy make bed sensors a promising technology in the long-term assessment of sleep in the home. Despite these advantages, these novel devices still require validation against accepted methodologies (ie, actigraphy).</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">In this study, we aimed to compare different sleep elements obtained with both actigraphy and a bed sensor in the home setting in a cohort of healthy individuals.</citation_analysis></p>

        <title>Study Design and Participants</title>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">This is a cross-sectional study. Subjects were enrolled between May and August 2020. Written informed consent for study inclusion was obtained from a parent or legal guardian for all minors (5–17 years). Written informed consent was collected from adults aged 18 and older. The study was approved by the Oregon Health &amp; Science University Institutional Review Board, and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Thirty subjects (17 women) were recruited from the community via flyers and direct contact. Subjects were eligible to participate in the study if a) they were between the ages of 5 to 65 years; b) they were able to provide consent; c) they slept the majority of nights in the same bed. Subjects were excluded if: a) they could not follow the study protocol (ie, complete the sleep diary and exit survey); b) they did not sleep most nights in the same bed. Subjects were not excluded based on the presence of a sleep disturbance or based on whether they slept alone or co-slept.</citation_analysis></p>

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">This cross-sectional study found an excellent correlation between a bed sensor and an actigraphy watch for bed entry time, sleep start, sleep end, bed exit time, and rest interval duration. There was a poor correlation between the two WASO estimates among subjects younger than 18 years but a moderate correlation among subjects older than 18 years. Compared with actigraphy, the bed sensor showed high specificity and accuracy but lower sensitivity. Fifteen percent of our subjects found wearing the actigraph burdensome, whereas none found using the bed sensor burdensome.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">In our study, we used various methods to determine the degree of agreement between the two devices. The method proposed by Bland and Altman offers the advantage of establishing limits of agreement with a 5% probability of error and has been adopted by various sleep validation studies.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> In a study of 50 healthy children, Werner et al used Bland–Altman plots to determine the degree of agreement between actigraphy and a sleep diary.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> A priori, the authors established a 30-minute time interval as the minimal clinically important change. In other words, a difference of 30 minutes or more between the two methods in the estimation of sleep parameters was considered of clinical significance.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> In our study, the differences between the two devices fell within 30-minutes for all the parameters examined, except for WASO. Despite our findings, whether a 30-minute cutoff is acceptable for the interchangeable use of different sleep assessment modalities remains a question that needs to be answered from the clinical perspective. In addition to the Bland–Altman analysis, we measured the correlation between the two devices using ICC. Our analysis shows a moderate to excellent ICC for all sleep parameters except for WASO estimates among subjects younger than 18 years. The ICC for WASO is also higher among co-sleepers, probably indicating that younger subjects are more likely to sleep alone. WASO is a measurement of sleep disruption commonly used in clinical and research settings. These discrepancies should be considered when selecting one device over another to monitor sleep patterns, particularly among younger individuals.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">This study found the bed sensor to be excellent in detecting wake with a specificity of 93.5. The accuracy was also high at 88.8. However, the sensitivity (ie, the bed sensor’s ability to detect sleep) was lower at 0.62. The bed sensor, which is placed under the mattress, may detect movements not detected by the actigraphy watch, particularly the lower limbs. Comparative studies between the bed sensor, actigraphy, and PSG are needed to clarify these observations.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Our study has several strengths. First, all measurements were taken at home, with minimally invasive methods, which produced negligible distortion in sleep patterns. Second, our cohort consisted of subjects with a wide age range (the youngest subjects were 6 years old). This age range was chosen in order to provide agreement data for both children and adults. Third, although both Phillips Respironics Inc. and Emfit Inc. provide sleep detection algorithms, we manually reviewed and scored all the sleep recordings. We make no claims as to the accuracy of Emfit’s commercially available, automated algorithm. Several studies have demonstrated acceptable agreement rates between automatic scoring of actigraphy and PSG.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27–30</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> However, in a large study of individuals with insomnia, Hauri and Wisbey found discrepancies of up to 49 minutes of rest interval duration between actigraphy scored using automatic algorithms and PSG.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> More importantly, in a study using Actiwatch 2, Chow et al demonstrated that automated algorithms could not accurately detect rest intervals compared to manual scoring.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Although our study shows a high correlation between manually scored bed sensor and actigraphy data, this is a lengthy process that requires expertise and may not be feasible in large studies. Further research is needed to establish the correlation between different automated methods and direct human observation.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Our findings are particularly useful for those practitioners who need to assess sleep parameters in situations where traditional PSG, sleep diaries, or actigraphy may be challenging to implement. These situations include documentation of sleep patterns in the home setting, over prolonged periods, or in specific populations. For instance, persons with lower cognitive functioning, psychopathology, or other neurological problems often have difficulties filling out sleep diaries.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Our data shows agreement between the bed sensor data alone versus hand-curated diary plus actigraphy data. These findings are of relevance to situations in which sleep diaries are difficult to obtain. In our study, more subjects in our cohort found actigraphy to be burdensome when compared to the bed sensor. In addition, the majority of subjects chose the bed sensor as their only preferred method for sleep monitoring over a one-month period. To date, most devices designed to offer an alternative to wrist-worn actigraphy remain at the prototype stage or have been insufficiently validated.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Our data suggest that bed sensors might provide a reliable, feasible, and less burdensome alternative to actigraphy.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Our study has several limitations. First, actigraphy is not considered the gold standard for the assessment of sleep. Furthermore, actigraphy does not assess electroencephalographic manifestations of sleep, including the distinction between rapid eye movement (REM) versus non-REM sleep. Despite these limitations, actigraphy offers clear advantages over the gold standard (polysomnography), particularly in the ambulatory setting, and is recognized by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine as a valid method in determining sleep patterns.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Our main goal was to compare two technologies with similar applications in the home setting and advantages across specific populations or situations. In their study, Choi et al compared sleep-wake measurements obtained with “bed actigraphy” (measured by load-sensing cells supporting the bed) and PSG.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> The mean epoch-by-epoch agreement between the two devices was 95.2%. A similar comparison between the bed sensor used in our study and PSG would be desirable. However, such a comparison alone would not address our scientific question because PSG is not routinely used in longitudinal, population-based, prospective studies of sleep. In addition to documenting agreement among different sleep measuring techniques, research also needs to focus on understanding the sources of discrepancies and promote their complementary use. Second, heart and respiratory rates (HR/RR), provided by the bed sensor, were not included in the analysis. The bed sensor provides HR/RR data, but the actigraphy watches do not. Our goal was to validate both devices using similar rating methods. While HR/RR do change with sleep, there are no established criteria for the definitive scoring of sleep based on changes in these vital signs, and differences in HR/RR between non-REM and REM sleep would further complicate the distinction of REM from wake on the basis of HR/RR alone. Also, to our knowledge, there are no published studies supporting the validity and reliability of HR/RR measurements by the bed sensors during different stages of sleep. Third, our cohort mainly consisted of healthy individuals. Agreement between the two devices may be lower in certain subjects (eg, patients with sleep disorders or depression) who often lay in bed motionless without sleeping.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> We did not find agreement differences when comparing subjects with insomnia versus those without insomnia. However, this was an exploratory analysis, and the study was not powered to detect small discrepancies. Last, we did not inquire whether subjects slept with a pet, which could have influenced sleep sensor data.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">The bed sensor may be particularly useful in situations where adherence to actigraphy monitoring devices is low. However, despite the bed sensor’s advantages, actigraphy offers certain benefits. For instance, the bed sensor does not provide daytime activity levels, which can be used to deduce lifestyle, and to some extent, circadian rhythm. In addition, actigraphy may still be preferred in subjects who do not sleep in the same bed consistently. When designing a sleep-related study, investigators are encouraged to take into account the characteristics of the study population and to utilize various measurements of sleep in order to get more accurate information regarding sleep patterns.</citation_analysis></p>
