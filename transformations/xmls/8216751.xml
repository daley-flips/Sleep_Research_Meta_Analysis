          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Over half of the participants reported poor sleep quality (51.8%). The rate of poor sleep was lowest in the second trimester. Women who were unmarried had &gt;12 years of education, exercised &lt;3 days/week, were in the third trimester, had a high level of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP) and had a history of infertility had a higher risk of poor sleep. Pregnancy-related factors contributed most to poor sleep. In the first trimester, the main risk factors for poor sleep were a history of infertility and a high level of NVP. In the second trimester, only a high level of NVP was a risk factor for poor sleep. In the last trimester, the risk factors for poor sleep were more education years, exercise &lt;3 days/week and high levels of NVP.</citation_analysis></p>

PSQI&gt;5 was defined as poor sleep quality, while a score ≤5 was regarded as good sleep, as in most published studies.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></citation_analysis></p>

        <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Covariables were categorized into three groups: 1, demographic factors; 2, lifestyle factors; and 3, pregnancy-related factors. Demographic factors included age, education, marriage and employment. Lifestyle factors included sedentary time and exercise frequency. Pregnancy-related factors included trimester of pregnancy, parity, nausea and vomiting and history of infertility.</citation_analysis></p>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">The severity of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP) was measured by means of the Chinese version of the Pregnancy Unique Quantification of Emesis Scale (PUQE).</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> The scale consists of 3 items. Every item is given a score from 1 to 5, and the total PUQE score ranges from 3 to 15. A higher score means more severe NVP. According to the recommendation of the PUQE scale, NVP was divided into mild NVP (3~6), moderate NVP (7~12) and severe NVP (13~15). We intended to compare the prevalence of poor sleep among women with severe NVP to those with mild or moderate NVP. However, the rate of severe NVP was too low (1.7%). Therefore, we chose PUQE≥11 (the five percent cut-off point) as the cut-off for high levels of NVP.</citation_analysis></p>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Data on other covariables, including age, employment, marriage, education, family income, sedentary time, exercise frequency, trimester of pregnancy, parity and history of infertility, were all collected by self-report. Trimesters of pregnancy were divided into first (≤12 weeks), second (13~27 weeks) and third trimesters (≥28 weeks) according to gestational age. Parity was divided into primipara and multipara. Employment was divided into employed and unemployed. Marriage was divided into married and unmarried (including divorced, widowed and single). Education was divided into ≤12 years and &gt;12 years. Sedentary time was divided into &lt;7 hour ≥7 hours. Exercised frequency was divided into ≥3 and &lt;3 times per week. The question “Have you ever been diagnosed with infertility by a doctor?” was used to collect the infertility data. The answer “yes” was classified as with history of infertility and “no” was classified as without history of infertility.</citation_analysis></p>

        <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">A final sample comprising 2281 pregnant women with data on sleep quality was included in this study. Over half of the participants reported poor sleep quality (51.9%, 95% CI=49.8–53.9%) among all participants. The rate in the first trimester was 52.8% (95% CI=48.1–57.5%). The prevalence of poor sleep in the second trimester was the lowest (44.7%, 95% CI= 41.5–47.9%), and the rate in the last trimester was the highest (59.2%, 95% CI= 55.9–62.4%) among the three trimesters. The changing trend in the PSQI mean score throughout pregnancy was similar to the prevalence of poor sleep.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="negative">In the present study, we studied the prevalence and risk factors for poor sleep among all participants and in different trimesters of pregnancy among pregnant women in China. The prevalence of poor sleep was 51.9% among all participants. Women who married, received &gt;12 years of education, exercise &lt;3 days/week, in the third trimester, had a high level of NVP and a history of infertility had a higher risk of poor sleep during pregnancy. Pregnancy-related factors contributed most to poor sleep quality. The main risk factors for poor sleep were different among the three trimesters of pregnancy. In the first trimester, the main risk factors for poor sleep were a history of infertility and a high level of NVP. In the second trimester, only a high level of NVP was a risk factor for poor sleep. In the last trimester, the risk factors for poor sleep were more education years, exercise &lt;3 days/week and high levels of NVP.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">The prevalence of poor sleep was 51.9%, much higher than that of the general population (26.5%) in China</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> and slightly higher than that in Sedov’s study (45.7%).</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> The prevalences of poor sleep in Sedov’s and the present study presented decreasing trends from the first trimester to the second trimester and increasing trends from the second trimester to the third trimester. The PSQI score and prevalence of poor sleep were highest in the third trimester. Taken together, these data implied that it was important for clinicians to screen for and address sleep problems prior to the first and, especially, the third trimester of pregnancy.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The risk factors for poor sleep among all participants were unmarried status, education over 12 years, exercise less than 3 days per week, third-trimester pregnancy status, a high level of NVP and a history of infertility. Unmarried women were shown to have a higher risk of poor sleep in the present study. However, it was hard to find previous studies to support this result, as there is a lack of studies on this relationship. In fact, in most societies globally, it is stressful for an unmarried woman to have a baby, which may lead to more mental stress and a higher risk of poor sleep among unmarried pregnant women.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The relationship between sleep and education was interesting in that higher educational level was a risk factor for poor sleep. Some studies reported similar results,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> but others found that women with lower education had a higher likelihood of poor sleep.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Some studies have demonstrated that there is no relationship between them.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> In general, women with a higher educational level had more knowledge and skills to maintain health and had better sleep quality. However, women with a higher educational level might experience more pressure and worse sleep because they tend to undertake a more important role in the workplace. This situation may be worse for women in the last trimester of pregnancy, as shown in </citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> and </citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figures 1B</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> and </citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">2B</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">. This may be because many women a lower educational level quit jobs to be housewives, but most of the women with a higher educational level continue working in the last trimester of pregnancy. Further studies focusing on educational level and sleep should include other covariables, such as work status, mental health and health knowledge.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Regarding lifestyle, the relationship between exercise and sleep quality implied that exercise was important to maintain good sleep quality, especially in the last trimester. A recent systematic review reported that exercise could enhance the quality of sleep,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> and a clinical randomized controlled trial demonstrated that exercise training improves sleep quality.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Across pregnancy, the sleep quality among women with exercise ≥3 days/week was better than that of women with less exercise, especially in the third trimester. Thus, clinicians should advise pregnant women to exercise more frequently, especially in the last trimester.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="negative">Among the three clusters, pregnancy-related factors contributed most to poor sleep. Three pregnancy-related factors, namely, trimester of pregnancy, NVP and history of infertility, were found to be related to sleep quality during pregnancy. Women with a high level of NVP had a higher risk of poor sleep in both the whole regression model and three-subgroup regression models. NVP is a common and uncomfortable aspect of pregnancy. This discomfort during pregnancy makes it difficult for women to sleep well or at all. EnginYıldırım’s</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> research also found that women with HG had higher PSQI scores. The ORs of poor sleep among women with high levels of NVP in the first and third trimesters were higher than those of women in the second trimester. </citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figures 1D</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> and </citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">2D</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> also supports these results. Additionally, it was easy to understand that the odds ratio was highest in the first trimester, as most NVPs were present in the first trimester. Curiously, the odds ratio was also high in the third trimester. Women with high levels of NVP should be screened for sleep quality, especially in the first and third trimesters.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Women with a history of infertility tended to report poor sleep more often in the present study. Similar results were present only in the first-trimester subgroup regression. This may be because women with a history of infertility may be more anxious about pregnancy and more likely to have poor sleep quality, especially in the first trimester, when pregnancy is not very stable However, no previous study has focused on a history of infertility and poor sleep. The sample size may need to be enlarged in future studies to verify this result. Obstetricians should pay more attention to sleep quality among pregnant women with a history of infertility in the first trimester.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">In conclusion, the prevalence and risk factors for poor sleep were different among different trimesters. Clinicians should screen and address poor sleep prior to the first and third trimesters of pregnancy, especially the third trimester. The management of poor sleep should be consistent throughout pregnancy and be adjusted in different trimesters.</citation_analysis></p>

      <title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Although many pregnant women complain of poor sleep quality during pregnancy, few studies have reported the different risk factors for poor sleep quality during different trimesters of pregnancy. This study presents the prevalence of and risk factors for poor sleep quality across pregnancy. In addition, an interesting factor, history of infertility, was found to be related to poor sleep quality, especially in the first trimester.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">However, this study had several limitations. First, data on some variables, such as obstructive sleep apnoea, restless legs syndrome, workforce status and body mass index, which were reported to be related to sleep quality, were not collected in this study. In addition, self-report questionnaires may lead to some report bias. Last, as a cross-sectional study, we cannot determine the causality between factors and outcome variables.</citation_analysis></p>
