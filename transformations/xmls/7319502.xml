          <title>Purpose</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is less prevalent among women and is associated with different symptoms and consequences to OSA in men. The reasons for these differences are unknown and difficult to tease apart in clinical populations. If OSA could be temporarily induced in healthy men and women, the causes of some of these differences could be investigated. Nasal blocking has been used to induce OSA in healthy men but its effect in women has not been reported.</citation_analysis></p>

          <title>Patients and Methods</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">A total of 14 healthy individuals (10 women) underwent in-laboratory diagnostic sleep studies on two occasions separated by a week. On one occasion, the nasal passages were blocked, whereas on the other occasion, participants slept naturally. In both conditions, a full-face mask was used to monitor respiratory events. Participants’ self-reported sleepiness, mood and performance on a motor learning task were assessed in the evening and morning of both sleep studies. Furthermore, endothelial function and self-reported sleep quality were assessed in the morning following each study.</citation_analysis></p>

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is more common and associated with different symptoms and consequences in men as compared to women. The reasons for these differences are unknown and difficult to tease apart in clinic populations. Blocking the nose during sleep has been shown to induce OSA in otherwise healthy men, but no studies of nasal occlusion have been conducted in women to date. This study demonstrates that nasal occlusion induces OSA in otherwise healthy young women raising the possibility that nasal blockage may be useful technique for investigating sex differences in OSA.</citation_analysis></p>

Participants then rated the quality of their sleep on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (very poor) to 10 (excellent), and reported how strongly they agreed with experiencing “Vivid dreams”, “Snoring”, “Gasping for air/feeling like I was choking” and “Feeling sweaty” (1 strongly disagree, 10 strongly agree).

Subjective sleepiness and sleep quality as well as the other polysomnographic characteristics and secondary outcome variables were also compared between the experimental and control conditions using Student’s t-tests for all participants (men and women combined). Exploratory Pearson’s correlations were conducted to ascertain whether the overnight change in AHI was associated with baseline AHI or demographic characteristics (age, BMI, MAPI). In addition, preliminary insight into whether sex differences in OSA characteristics exist was determined by comparing sleep study variables between sexes. Due to only 4 men being studied, we have not reported p values but rather effect sizes, which were manually calculated (using the following equation: r= z ÷√n). Effect sizes were interpreted according to Cohen’s (1988) criteria, which defined small, medium and large effect sizes as being equivalent to 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5, respectively.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> All analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics 25 software (Armonk, NY).

Only the AHI on the baseline night (which ranged from 0 to 7.9) was correlated with the magnitude of increase in AHI between conditions. Likewise, the four women who developed severe OSA on the blocked nose night appeared to have worse sleep quality and more REM-related events even on their control night perhaps indicating these individuals were lighter sleepers with a predisposition to airway collapse at least in REM. While blocking the nose clearly increased the AHI, it may have also independently disturbed sleep because the spontaneous arousal index and wake after sleep onset time were also increased on the blocked nose night while total sleep time was reduced in contrast to what is typically observed in at least chronic OSA.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> In addition, the OSA that was induced was associated with relatively mild blood oxygen desaturation (90% average, ODI = 15 events/hr) and was similar between body positions and NREM versus REM sleep. Finally, snoring was not commonly noted by the overnight staff. Thus, the OSA that was induced by blocking the nose appears to differ somewhat from spontaneously occurring OSA.</citation_analysis></p>

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Although there were very few men studied, the characteristics of the induced OSA appear similar between sexes.

Alternatively, the similarity in OSA characteristics observed between sexes in this study may be related to the unique and un-natural cause of airway collapse (obligatory oral breathing) whereas the pathophysiology of naturally occurring airway collapse may cause the differences in OSA characteristic between sexes that are typically observed. For example, if the upper airway dilator muscles of women were more effective at holding open/re-opening the collapsible segment of the upper airway than the dilator muscles in men, it could explain why men get more OSA, have longer events (they are more reliant on arousal to re-open the airway) and why women would be relatively protected from events in NREM sleep compared to men but equally susceptible in REM (when the benefit of improved dilator muscle effectiveness would be reduced). Likewise, if sex differences in sleep-related breathing route preference exist then this advantage would have been removed in the current study. Further research with suitable numbers of men and women are required to assess such possibilities.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="negative">Despite quite notable group changes in the AHI and subjective reports of increased sleepiness on the morning following the blocked nose condition, the self-reported mood and performance on the motor sequence task were not altered between conditions. This may relate to the fact that sleep was relatively well preserved (N2 and REM were unchanged between conditions and N3 was reduced from 24% to 16% of total sleep time). Alternatively, these analyses may have been underpowered. However, it is also possible that one night of OSA is insufficient to elicit these consequences of OSA, particularly in this young cohort. Similarly, cardiovascular function may only be altered by events associated with more severe hypoxemia or exposure to respiratory events over more than one night. Future research studies employing multiple nights sleeping with the nasal passages blocked in a larger sample may be required to separate these possibilities.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The study is limited by several factors, including the different cause of OSA compared to the natural situation, possible additional sleep disturbance from the intervention itself, and small number of men included in this study. A further limitation was the fact that it was not possible to blind participants as to the experimental condition. This was particularly problematic as, for safety reasons, participants were warned during the initial screening session that they may experience poorer sleep during the experimental condition and therefore should not schedule it before important activities the next day such as exams or long drives. It is therefore plausible that morning performance following the experimental intervention may have been influenced by participant expectation.</citation_analysis></p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">This study has shown that OSA can be induced in otherwise healthy, young normal weight women by blocking the nasal passages for a single night. However, the induced OSA appeared to differ somewhat from naturally occurring OSA. Therefore, whether blocking the nose to induce OSA will be useful for future research studies will depend on the question being asked. It is possible that more than one night is required to more adequately represent OSA and its consequences. We would advise anyone attempting such research to try to recruit individuals who report snoring or who have baseline AHIs in the high normal range (AHI 3–5) in order to maximise the chances of inducing significant OSA during nasal blockage.</citation_analysis></p>
