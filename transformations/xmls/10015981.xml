          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Idiopathic hypersomnia is a debilitating sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep inertia, and prolonged sleep duration. The patient burden of idiopathic hypersomnia is poorly understood. The Real World Idiopathic Hypersomnia Outcomes Study (ARISE) evaluated symptoms and treatment effectiveness/satisfaction in participants with idiopathic hypersomnia.</citation_analysis></p>

          <title>Methods</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">ARISE was a United States–based virtual cross-sectional survey. Participants were adults 21–65 years of age with idiopathic hypersomnia recruited from social media, the Hypersomnia Foundation website, and a patient panel. Self-assessments included the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Idiopathic Hypersomnia Severity Scale (IHSS), Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication, version II (TSQM-vII), and additional treatment questions. Data were analyzed for all participants and for subgroups with/without long sleep time (LST; ≥11 hours in 24 hours).</citation_analysis></p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Of 75 participants enrolled, most were female (81.3%). The mean (SD) age was 34.1 (10.7) years and 49% had LST. Most participants took off-label prescription medications (89.3%) and/or used other measures (93.3%) to manage their symptoms. The mean (SD) ESS score was 14.5 (3.5) and the mean IHSS score was 35.2 (7.6). Treatment satisfaction was low (mean [SD] TSQM-vII score: overall, 61.9 [21.2]; with LST, 57.9 [21.4]; without LST, 66.7 [20.3]), primarily driven by dissatisfaction with treatment effectiveness. The most common classes of prescription medications used were stimulants (61.3%), wake-promoting agents (28.0%), and antidepressants (18.7%); non-prescription measures used to manage symptoms included caffeine (73.3%), planned naps (34.7%), and individual accommodations (32.0%).</citation_analysis></p>

          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Overall, participants with idiopathic hypersomnia, with or without LST, had substantial symptom burden despite most of the study population taking off-label medications and using nonprescription measures to manage symptoms.</citation_analysis></p>

      <title>Plain Language Summary</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Idiopathic hypersomnia is a disabling neurologic sleep disorder with no known cause. People with this disorder are extremely sleepy during the day and often need to sleep for long amounts of time. They may sleep and nap over 11 hours in a normal day, yet still find it hard to wake up and think clearly. Many prescription treatments (mostly not FDA approved) and changes in habits have been tried to improve the symptoms. However, most patients with idiopathic hypersomnia still cannot function well in many areas of their lives. We used an online survey to better understand how idiopathic hypersomnia and its treatments affect people’s lives. The survey was completed by 75 adults with idiopathic hypersomnia. About half of them slept longer than 11 hours in a normal day. Most of them took a prescription medication and used other measures to help manage their idiopathic hypersomnia. However, most still had a large burden from their symptoms. Overall satisfaction with treatments was low. These findings more clearly define the patient burden of idiopathic hypersomnia. More effective therapies could address this symptom burden.</citation_analysis></p>

The objectives of ARISE were to assess and characterize the severity of idiopathic hypersomnia symptoms, to evaluate participants’ perceptions regarding satisfaction and effectiveness of their current treatment regimen, and to examine how idiopathic hypersomnia impacts participants’ lives, including their emotional well-being, daily activities, cognition, productivity/employment, and relationships.

Participants were required to select idiopathic hypersomnia both times to be eligible for inclusion in the study. Individuals who also had a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea were excluded in order for the study results to be due to idiopathic hypersomnia alone, given the high amount of symptom overlap with obstructive sleep apnea.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Exclusion criteria were the inability to read or understand English and having no access to a computer or a mobile device to send and receive text messages.

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The ARISE study was conducted to provide real-world data on symptom severity, symptom management, and treatment satisfaction in participants with idiopathic hypersomnia. The demographic characteristics of the ARISE study population were generally consistent with other recent, larger studies of people with idiopathic hypersomnia (eg, mean age [years] in the mid-30s and mostly female).</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Approximately half of participants in ARISE had LST; this proportion is similar to what was observed in a registry study but higher than that seen in a randomized clinical trial.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Most ARISE participants had ESS scores in the pathological range. The mean ESS score from the ARISE population (14.5; 89.3% treated with medications) was similar to that of patients with idiopathic hypersomnia at baseline in a randomized, controlled study (14.0–15.0).</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> The ESS scores in ARISE were slightly higher than those from 2 observational studies.

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The present findings demonstrate a substantial burden of idiopathic hypersomnia symptoms that is characterized not just by EDS (as assessed with the ESS), but also sleep inertia, cognitive difficulties, and unrefreshing sleep (as assessed with the IHSS). This burden was observed despite most patients being treated with the off-label medications that were available at the time of the study and also using other nonprescription measures to manage their idiopathic hypersomnia symptoms. This broad symptom burden was also reflected in a larger real-world study from the Hypersomnia Foundation (HF) in which brain fog, difficulty remembering things, and difficulty waking up and functioning with normal alertness were reported by approximately 72% to 83% of 468 participants with idiopathic hypersomnia, nearly all of whom also reported EDS.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Even with treatment, more than half of those participants still experienced EDS (64.1%), trouble waking up and functioning with normal alertness (61.1%), and brain fog (54.0%). Consistent with this, ARISE participants identified EDS, brain fog, and sleep inertia as the symptoms that were the most difficult to treat. These symptoms of idiopathic hypersomnia have previously been demonstrated to have a negative impact on quality of life and functioning.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> This presents a challenge in treatment, as therapies that are effective at reducing EDS may not be sufficient in managing the burden of other symptoms in people with idiopathic hypersomnia.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Most ARISE participants (89.3%) reported taking off-label prescription medications for idiopathic hypersomnia symptoms, most commonly stimulants, followed by wake-promoting agents. These results are consistent with those from the HF registry study,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> implying that no better approved pharmacotherapy options had appeared in the interim between these 2 studies.

In ARISE, treatment satisfaction was evaluated with the TSQM-vII, which demonstrated that participants with idiopathic hypersomnia had low global satisfaction with the treatments available to them at the time. ARISE participants reported a mean global satisfaction score of 61.9, which is lower than that reported by people in a TSQM validation study who rated their health as “poor” (64.8) or their illness as “severe” (67.3).</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Additional TSQM-vII results from ARISE indicated that the primary shortcoming of treatments was their effectiveness; tolerability and convenience appeared to have relatively minor roles in contributing to the poor global satisfaction. This is consistent with a previous survey of people with idiopathic hypersomnia, in which they rated medication effectiveness as 5.4 on a 10-point scale (with 1 being “not effective”).</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">In addition to off-label prescription medications, more than 90% of participants in the present study also adopted measures other than prescription medications to manage their symptoms. The most common of these were caffeine, planned naps, and individual accommodations, such as sleeping longer and having a delayed morning start time. This is similar to another survey study, in which most people with idiopathic hypersomnia reported using caffeine (82.2%), scheduled nighttime sleep (75.2%), and daytime naps (81.4%) for symptom management.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> However, these symptom management options do not appear to be as effective as they are in people with narcolepsy; for example, intentional napping during the day is typically unrefreshing for people with idiopathic hypersomnia.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Collectively, these results underscore that there was an unmet need for therapies with better efficacy. At the time of this study, there were no approved treatments for idiopathic hypersomnia.

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Although the ARISE study was not designed to evaluate group differences between participants with or without LST, several other studies have reported on LST phenotype differences. In the HF study, a greater proportion of participants with LST reported having trouble waking and maintaining alertness (88.3%), experiencing brain fog (86.9%), and needing to use more than 1 alarm to wake up (77.5%), compared with those without LST (69.3%, 78.1%, and 61.7%, respectively).</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Two studies reported no difference in ESS scores based on LST phenotype.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> However, participants with LST (defined as sleeping &gt;10 hours at night or &gt;11 hours in a 24-hour period) had significantly worse scores on the Fatigue Severity Scale and the Sleep Inertia Questionnaire compared with participants without LST.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">The ARISE study has limitations. This study was entirely internet based, and as such, all data were self-reported. The most important variables potentially affected by this were the idiopathic hypersomnia diagnosis and the LST groupings. To increase confidence in the validity of the self-reported diagnosis, participants were asked to answer this question twice during screening, with different wording (a methodology used by a previous real-world study).</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> The LST groupings were based on the participants’ self-reported assessments of hours slept, and may be less accurate than data measured in a sleep clinic. It is possible that the results would be different if objective measures of sleep duration had been used to group participants into the LST and non-LST categories. As ARISE was a real-world study, participants were not randomized to their treatments, and no causal attribution of reported differences according to treatment should be inferred. Individuals who participated in the study may have been motivated to do so because they were less happy with their symptom management, whereas those who had better symptom management may have not felt the need to participate. For participants who reported comorbidities, information on whether those comorbidities were sufficiently managed with treatments was not collected. Because the aim of the ARISE study was to gain real-world data on the experience of people with idiopathic hypersomnia, no healthy controls or individuals with other sleep disorders (eg, narcolepsy) were included. The sample size in ARISE (N=75) is smaller compared with another real-world study of people with idiopathic hypersomnia (N=468).</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Finally, the study population was entirely within the US; thus, some findings may not be applicable in other countries.</citation_analysis></p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">People with idiopathic hypersomnia in the ARISE study demonstrated a significant burden of disease, which warrants effective therapy. Many participants reported this high disease burden despite differences in symptom management with off-label medications and other means, and regardless of LST phenotype. The findings from this real-world study provide valuable insight into the unique characteristics and unmet treatment needs of people with idiopathic hypersomnia. With the US FDA approval of the first treatment indicated for adults with idiopathic hypersomnia, a more complete understanding of the symptom burden of idiopathic hypersomnia is important to accurately assess therapeutic impact. Additional studies should be conducted to further quantify these unmet needs in people with idiopathic hypersomnia. Available therapies with demonstrated efficacy over the symptoms of idiopathic hypersomnia may help to reduce this patient burden.</citation_analysis></p>
