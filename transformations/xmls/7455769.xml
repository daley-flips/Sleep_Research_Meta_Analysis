          <title>Purpose</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">As tau pathology is involved in impaired postoperative learning and memory in rats, we attempted to identify the possible mechanisms by which tau pathology affects postoperative sleep deprivation.</citation_analysis></p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="s2002">
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned into six groups as follows: the Control group, Anaesthesia group, Surgery group, Sleep deprivation (SD) group: 24-h SD with the modified multiple platform method (MMPM), Anaesthesia and SD (ASD) group, and Surgery and SD (SSD) group. Tau396 and FOXQ1 protein expression levels in the hippocampal neurons of all groups were analysed. Changes following co-culture of hippocampal neurons with IL-6 were detected by flow cytometry.</citation_analysis></p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="s2003">
          <title>Results</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Twenty-four hours of acute SD decreased the error scores on postoperative day 5 in the ASD and SSD groups compared with the Anaesthesia and Surgery groups. Compared with the tau levels in the Control group, tau levels in the Anaesthesia and Surgery groups were increased, but SD decreased the expression of tau in the ASD and SSD groups. The expression levels of tau and FOXQ1 were inversely regulated. When hippocampal neurons were co-cultured with IL-6, the same changes were observed.</citation_analysis></p>

          <title>Conclusion</title>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">In our present research, we found that anaesthesia and surgery increased total error scores during the Y-maze test compared with the Control group, and that postoperative 24-h acute SD may alleviate such increases even though the total error scores in the ASD and SSD groups were still higher than those in the Control group. Compared with IL-6 in the Control group, hippocampal and plasma IL-6 was more pronounced in the SSD group. ASD and SSD exacerbated BBB leakage, as demonstrated by EB fluorescence, and the hippocampal neurons of these two groups exhibited mitochondrial swelling, vacuolation and endoplasmic reticulum dilatation when viewed by transmission electron microscopy. These results showed that ASD and SSD may increase peripheral and central IL-6 levels and influence BBB leakage and hippocampal neurons. Further evidence has shown colocalization of phosphorylated tau and IL-6 or FOXQ1 and that anaesthesia and surgery may induce the expression of phosphorylated tau, but SD may alleviate this induction. Tau and FOXQ1 expression levels were inversely regulated. Finally, we tested this trend using hippocampal neurons co-cultured with IL-6. As expected, all analyses revealed that IL-6 simultaneously increases the expression of FOXQ1 and decreases tau396 expression. Postoperative 24-h acute SD improved learning and memory through inhibition of tau phosphorylation and increased IL-6-induced expression of FOXQ1 in the hippocampal neurons of splenectomized rats.</citation_analysis></p>

Although sleep fragmentation (SF) and surgery independently produce significant memory impairment, perioperative SF significantly increases hippocampal inflammation without further cognitive impairment.
