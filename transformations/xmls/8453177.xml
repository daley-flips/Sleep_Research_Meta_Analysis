      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAS) is one of the most common sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Among different types of SAS, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is highly prevalent among all age-based groups of adults. Based on the literature,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> China has the largest number of OSA patients, approximately 175 million, accounting for 23.6% of the investigated individuals (range of age, 30–69 years old). As the population of overweight or obese people, as well as aging individuals, is increasing, the prevalence of OSA is expected to increase accordingly. The main clinical features of OSA are snoring, morning headache, excessive daytime sleepiness, and memory loss. OSA may also lead to several commodities, such as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and diabetes mellitus.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Epidemiological studies have shown that OSA is an independent risk factor of CVDs, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, heart failure, and stroke.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Considering the prevalence and negative influences of CVDs on the Chinese population,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> it could be speculated that OSA imposes a heavy national socioeconomic burden.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="negative">However, due to the lack of awareness, the majority of patients in China do not refer to hospitals until the appearance of severe complications of OSA. Moreover, the standard diagnosis requires clinical examinations, such as polysomnography (PSG) or home sleep apnea test (HSAT).</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Nevertheless, these methods are time-consuming, expensive, and labor-intensive, requiring to be performed in hospitals overnight by certified technicians. Therefore, nearly 90% of patients must wait for a prolonged period for the tests, leading to a delayed diagnosis in a large population.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="negative">Recently, smart wearable devices have facilitated the monitoring of wearers’ health status optimally. Among them, the accurate detection of pulse rate variability (PRV) and blood oxygen saturation by photoplethysmography (PPG) provides a novel tool for the ambulatory screening of OSA.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> The PPG measures the attenuated light reflected or absorbed by human blood vessels and tissues. Thus, the pulsating state of blood vessels and pulse wave can be recorded. Furthermore, conventional pulse oximeters use two LEDs at different wavelengths and a photodiode to estimate blood oxygen saturation noninvasively, based on the difference in absorption coefficients between hemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin. At present, PPG is an uncomplicated and inexpensive optical measurement method that is used in numerous devices (eg, smartwatches and phones). Several studies have reported promising results in the diagnosing of sleep-related respiratory disorders as follows: 1) Using the respiratory signals, major records that can reflect sleep duration and wakefulness, such as electroecardiogram (ECG) data,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> are extracted to provide a comprehensive sleep respiratory status. 2) Medical devices based on PPG technology are extensively utilized. According to the respiration or PRV signals (oral/nasal airflow or respiratory inductive plethysmography), the respiratory events could be assessed.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9–12</xref></citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">The smartwatch GT2 (HUAWEI Device Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China)</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> is a wearable device composed of seven sensors, including an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a geomagnetic sensor, an optical pulse rate sensor, an ambient light sensor, an air pressure sensor, and a capacitive sensor. PPG signals, based on the data of optical heart rate sensor and wrist pulse oximeter, are transmitted via the Bluetooth technology to a smartphone serving as a temporary data storage device, and then, are sent to a cloud data center for analysis. The data are imported into a proprietary algorithm to generate clinically relevant respiratory waveforms and PRV, and to detect the sleep-wake states, thereby evaluating the OSA. Thus, sleep time, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), and oxygen saturation could be estimated. Although the mentioned device is broadly utilized, its accuracy in screening of OSA, especially compared to other portable devices, is limited.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the feasibility and validity of a PPG-based smartwatch in the screening of OSA.

        <title>A PPG-Based Smartwatch</title>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">We used a smartwatch GT2 (HUAWEI Device Co., Ltd.) to capture PPG signals. This device utilizes a simple, noninvasive technique based on optically obtained volumetric measurements of an organ, that is, the wrist. The OSA screening algorithm was embedded into the smartwatch. PPG signals are frequently recorded using a pulse oximeter to detect blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of the tissue. Compared to end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><sub>2</sub></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">), the PPG-derived respiratory rate is more stable and less affected by the motion-induced artifact and patient talk.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Thus, combined with pulse oximetry, PPG is a robust tool for screening early respiratory compromise.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> A smartwatch detects a user’s motions. Using the spectra of PPG and acceleration signals, a rare while continuous activity in the patient was defined as “asleep,” and when a noticeable movement was detected, the patient was identified as “awake.” In the present study, data from sleep for &gt;7 h were deemed reliable and were included in the final analysis.</citation_analysis></p>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Using the machine learning algorithm and the overnight PPG signals, including green light, infrared light, and red-light sources, the initial screening model of sleep apnea was established. The PRV characteristics were extracted from green light signals, blood oxygen saturation data were estimated and extracted from infrared and red-light signals, and the risk of sleep apnea was evaluated by constructing a classification model based on the characteristics of PRV and blood oxygen saturation. In addition, the acceleration signal from the wrist was used for an effective signal screening and an abnormal scene discrimination. Subsequently, respiratory waveforms were derived from PPG signals, sleep time was recorded, and AHI was calculated.

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">In the present study, we demonstrated a promising diagnostic performance of OSA screening using a PPG-based smartwatch. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on OSA screening in China using a PPG-based smartwatch. The main findings were as follows: (1) smartwatch demonstrated a promising potential for the screening of OSA compared to HSAT or PSG test, especially in moderate-to-severe OSA patients; (2) no significant difference was detected in the results of PPG-based smartwatch compared to HSAT or PSG in screening of moderate-to-severe OSA patients.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">A smart device, such as a PPG-based smartwatch, was used to monitor the health status during sleep time. Firstly, its feasibility makes it extremely convenient to test at home. Secondly, the low load reduces disturbance during sleep monitoring. Finally, the repeatability and low cost can be conducive to screen OSA in a large population, considering the high prevalence of the condition in China.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Some studies have established a correlation between OSA and HRV,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> as well as blood oxygen saturation. Owing to the agreement between PRV and HRV,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> as well as the portability and continuity of PRV monitoring, we used PRV as a surrogate for HRV. The local changes in blood oxygen saturation were related to OSA, while the respiratory event-associated awakening could result in the maturation of heart rate and respiratory rate. These phenomena were captured by pulse wave signal. As well as monitoring of PRV, the smartwatch also uses three types of light simultaneously to monitor the blood oxygen saturation, including green light, red light, and infrared light. Thus, respiratory events can be measured more accurately than those assessed only by green light.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">In order to mimic a sleep environment, the majority of the patients (82/102, 80.4%) used HSAT for sleep monitoring. Although this might sacrifice the accuracy for mild OSA patients, it is an acceptable approach for the majority of the patients. In addition, patients using HSAT also undergo a strict evaluation of the indications, according to the AASM guidelines.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="negative">Due to the limitation in the detection, HSAT is only appropriate to identify moderate and severe OSA patients according to the AASM guidelines and suggestions,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> wherein AHI≥15.

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">We searched the literature concerning PPG-based technologies for screening of OSA (</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">) and retrieved several studies, wherein Morpheus Ox (WideMed Ltd, Herzliya, Israel) was compared with in-lab PSG among different populations. Specifically, the sensitivity and specificity were mostly between 80–95%, which are adequate for screening of OSA.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Nevertheless, the current study has three major limitations. First, a limited number of patients were recruited in this study. In previous studies,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> the sample size was relatively small, and bias to the results was inevitable. Secondly, our research subjects were snoring individuals with a high probability of OSA-positive, thereby deeming it as a high-risk population of OSA. In fact, it is reflected in the high prevalence (83/102, 81.3%) of OSA in our study population. Therefore, the effectiveness of smartwatch in the general population needs to be confirmed, which is also our further step of the study. Thirdly, as we concentrated only on AHI, the sleep/wake parameters and PPG-derived oxygen desaturation index were neglected, which need to be validated in the subsequent study, considering the poor performance in similar researches reported previously.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Intriguingly, a previous study</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> demonstrated that changes in skin color, tattoos, temperature, blood perfusion, erratic movement, and variations in skin pressure or even hairy wrists, as well as fluctuations, in oxygen levels affect the readings via PPG. The artifacts of PPG might be attributed to motion, vasomotor drugs, fluid administration, deep gasp, and heart rate changes.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> In the current study, we did not concentrate on the control of the external environment factors, and hence, the variable conditions among individuals might influence the accuracy of recognition of PPG signals. For instance, the optical signal would be affected when the smartwatch was not appropriately worn, in which loose wearing would leak the light, and very tight wearing would compress the blood vessels, reducing the blood flow. In such cases, the validity of the heartbeat cycle and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are weighed by the algorithm to determine validity of the optical signal.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The subjects in our study exhibited several complications, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, arrhythmia, and coronary heart disease. Only 13/102 (12.7%) patients had no other complications except for snoring. The most common complication was hypertension, which accounted for 32.4% of all patients. This reflects an urgent need for the screening of OSA among high-risk populations. Thus, we concluded that PPG could be beneficial for such populations.</citation_analysis></p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">In summary, the PPG-based smartwatch was found more effective in comparison to simultaneous in-lab PSG or HSAT devices in screening of suspected OSA cases, especially in screening of moderate-to-severe OSA patients. However, further development using a larger sample size study (ie, a general population or concentration on the home use of the devices and improved algorithm in the diagnostic veracity with multiple assessments at night) is required for a more reliable assessment.</citation_analysis></p>
