      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Approximately one-third of the general population has various forms of sleep-wake related disturbances, such as nocturnal insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and poor sleep quality.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Subjective poor sleep quality has been recognized as one of the most significant sleep-wake related parameters for predicting adverse physical and mental outcomes.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="negative"> Thus, in terms of personalized medicine, it is clinically imperative to identify the risk indicators for poor sleep quality and synergic factors that may further exacerbate their adverse impact on poor sleep quality.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Chronotype refers to a spectrum of individuals’ differences in circadian preference and is commonly categorized as morningness, intermediate, and eveningness preference.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Chronotype preference is known to be associated with sleep quality.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Individuals with eveningness preference are more likely to have poor sleep quality than individuals with morningness preference</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> and are more susceptible to mental</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> and physical morbidities.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> However, the mechanisms that underlie eveningness preference and adverse health outcomes remain unclear. Some individuals with eveningness preference have sleep patterns and social function comparable to those with morningness preference.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Furthermore, those with the eveningness preference may have better flexibility in re-entraining the circadian rhythm than those with the morningness preference.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Specifically, evening-type workers were able to adapt themselves to a fixed night shift.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Besides, evening-type shift workers also had better sleep quality with less impact on night shift than morning-type individuals.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> These unexpected findings may be derived from the heterogeneous sleep characteristics of eveningness preference, residual confounding, and moderation effect existing in the association between chronotype preference and sleep quality. Thus, before delivering specific interventions that mitigate the adverse impact of eveningness preference on sleep, it is vital to re-examine the relationship between chronotype and sleep quality using rigorously specified confounders and identify potential effect moderators.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">In the literature, in addition to genetic substrates, stress-related characters and maladaptive coping styles have also been found to be the determinants of chronotype.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Eveningness preference has been associated with trait anxiety;</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> novelty seeking; impulsivity; low persistence; low emotional stability; and low capacity for inhibiting, interrupting, and adapting current behaviors.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> In parallel, these features were also associated with poor sleep quality.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Thus, the core components of stress reaction could be important candidates that confound or moderate the relationship between chronotype and sleep quality. The development of stress reaction comprises multiplex and interlocked core components.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="negative"> According to stress-related theories, stress reaction is a dynamic and transactional process, which includes the individuals’ internal reactions to a situation in terms of physiological arousal, subjective emotional response, cognition and appraisal to stress, and their behavioral reaction.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> After interacting with the individuals’ specific personality traits, the encountered stressor leads to perceived stress, ensued by respective stress responses. Eventually, the resultant stress response is heterogeneous among individuals due to numerous combinations of core components embedded in the process of stress reaction,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> namely, different personalities, various perceived stress, and differential stress response. If we could tackle the complexity of the interlocked stress-related core components and disentangle the heterogeneity of stress reaction, we may be able to recognize and target the high-risk group.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">However, the heterogeneous phenotype of stress reaction constitutes several gaps that hinder us from examining the independent association between chronotype and sleep quality and further identifying high-risk group that warrants specific interventions. First, it is insufficient to evaluate stress reaction comprehensively with a single instrument. Besides, when we attempt to specify statistical models to partial out the effects of stress reaction that may confound the relationship between chronotype preference and sleep quality, the interrelated features of the core components of stress reaction also raise concerns about statistical collinearity. Third, when examining the moderation effect of stress reaction with heterogeneous profiles, numerous interaction terms have to be examined. In addition to the risk of inflated beta errors, the findings would be difficult to interpret intuitively and are not feasible for identifying high-risk groups. At present, latent class analysis (LCA) provides a solution to disentangle heterogeneity.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> By designating components of the process of stress reaction as indicator variables, LCA is capable of empirically clustering a heterogeneous group into several subgroups with distinct clinical features. As a result, we are able to control for the effects of all stress-related measurements with a single and categorized, LCA-derived subgroup variable. Moreover, instead of illustrating “variable-centered” relationships that are achieved in traditional regression modeling, LCA provides “person-centered” subgroups that are more feasible in terms of personalized medicine. Consequently, the issues of heterogeneity and collinearity are resolved simultaneously. To the best of our knowledge, there is no such an approach to tackle the gaps mentioned above, by LCA, in the literature.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Thus, this study aimed to examine the independent relationship between chronotype preference and sleep quality in a model that was rigorously controlled for core elements of the process of stress reaction. LCA, with a comprehensive set of stress-related measurement as indicator variables, was used to tackle the heterogeneity of stress reaction. A new categorical variable, stress susceptibility, was conceptualized to reflect the distinct features of LCA-derived subgroups. In this study, the “stress susceptibility” was defined by the core components of stress reaction and by its temporal order, namely personality, perceived stress, and then the stress response. In addition to the confounding effect of stress susceptibility, its moderation effect on the association between chronotype and sleep quality was also examined. We predicted that various chronotype preferences would correlate differentially with poor sleep quality. We further hypothesized that stress susceptibility would moderate the relationship between chronotype preference and sleep quality. Specifically, the relationship between chronotype preference and sleep quality would differ in heterogeneous stress susceptibility subgroups.</citation_analysis></p>

Furthermore, the influence of clustered stress susceptibility exerted on the abovementioned relationship was also investigated. We found that a strong preference for eveningness was associated with poor sleep quality, and this relationship was moderated by stress susceptibility. Specifically, the effect size of the relationship between eveningness preference and poor sleep quality was greater in the HSS group than in the LSS group. As a result, these findings were consistent with our hypotheses.</citation_analysis></p>

        <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Despite our findings, the mechanisms underlying the relationship between eveningness preference and poor sleep quality remain unclear. In this study, sleep quality was defined using PSQI scores, which contains several components of sleep quality.

For instance, evening-type people may intentionally advance bedtime to accommodate themselves to social rhythm, resulting in difficult sleep initiation and the use of hypnotics. Individuals with evening chronotype may stay up late working or studying and then experience circadian misalignment, which leads to sleep insufficiency, social jetlag and consequently daytime sleepiness or emotional dysregulation.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="negative"> Moreover, eveningness preference is related to night eating, which may also further delay bedtime and impair subjective sleep quality.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Although all of these behavior-related sleep-wake problems could be speculated to mediate the relationship between increased eveningness preference and high PSQI scores, the genuine mechanism needs further investigation.</citation_analysis></p>

The potential underlying mechanism for this moderating role of stress susceptibility is noteworthy. In fact, some individuals with eveningness preference may be self-afflicted bedtime procrastinators.

This kind of pre-sleep behavior may cause an epiphenomenon of eveningness preference and directly lead to poor sleep quality. In the sub-analysis, we found that eveningness preference may mediate the difference in sleep quality between the HSS and the LSS group. This finding further lends support to our argument about eveningness preference as a kind of maladaptive behavioral response to stress. However, bedtime procrastination was not measured in this study and our argument needs to be examined in future studies.</citation_analysis></p>

This finding implicates that not only in healthy people but also in those with non-acute status of mood disorders, the chronotype is still an independent risk indicator for poor sleep quality, regardless of residual depressive and anxiety symptoms. Thus, by identifying and returning unfavorable chronotypes, we could improve sleep quality and consequently promote health. Besides, high stress susceptibility may not compromise sleep quality by itself, but could synergize the adverse impact of unfavorable chronotype preference on sleep quality. Therefore, people with high stress susceptibility are the ultra high-risk group and may be benefited to a large extent from further detecting and modifying their maladaptive sleep-preventing behaviors. These non-pharmacological interventions could be integrated into programs of stress management for healthy people and non-acute patients with mood disorders as primary prevention and secondary prevention strategies.</citation_analysis></p>

      <title>Limitations</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">This study is subject to several limitations. First, this is a cross-sectional study, and determining the causal inference was not possible. Second, the results of this study may be biased by residual confounders, such as the use of psychotropics and primary sleep disorders. However, due to the possible bidirectional relationships between poor sleep quality with stress-related measurements and depressive symptoms,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> adding stress susceptibility and BDI-II to the statistical models may raise concerns of over-adjustment. However, even if this is the case, the result is likely to be biased toward the null. Third, the definition of stress susceptibility used in this study lacked consensus. Assigning different sets of indicator variables might yield different feature-based clusters; hence, the existence of the moderation effect may be questionable. Fourth, compared with the total sample, the number of participants in each subgroup was less in the stratified analysis due to stress susceptibility, which may compromise the statistical power to illustrate a significant within-group association between eveningness type and poor sleep quality. However, the examination of moderation effect in this study has illustrated the existence of between-group difference of effect sizes (HSS vs LSS) regarding the association between CSM and PSQI. Thus, from a statistical perspective, if given a large enough sample size in each subgroup, the non-significant effects within- or between-group would eventually turn significant, our main finding that indicates the between-group difference of effect remains valid. Finally, the present study adopted self-report psychometric instruments to evaluate chronotype and sleep quality. It is uncertain whether the relationship between chronotype and sleep quality remains the same if objective measurements are used. For example, measuring dim-light melatonin onset to anchor the inner biological rhythm and using polysomnography or actigraphy to collect sleep-wake parameters.</citation_analysis></p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Our findings have community-level and clinical-level practicability because they can be applied to both the health promotion program for general population and relapse prevention programs for people with mood disorders. In the future, longitudinal studies are needed to elucidate the temporal relationship between chronotype and sleep quality. Meanwhile, randomized control trial is necessary to examine the effect of specific interventions.</citation_analysis></p>
