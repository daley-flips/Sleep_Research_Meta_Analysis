          <title>Purpose</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">This study aimed to establish the diagnostic accuracy of a previously validated sleep staging system in patients with probable isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), and to compare physicians’ diagnoses of iRBD based on REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) to non-REM hypertonia (NRH), a sleep measure independently associated with Parkinsonian spectrum disorders.</citation_analysis></p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Patients and Methods</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Twenty-six patients with a history of dream enactment behavior underwent a diagnostic PSG with simultaneous Sleep Profiler (SP) acquisition at two sites. PSG and SP records were sleep staged, and two sleep neurologists independently diagnosed iRBD based on the presence or absence of polysomnographic identified RSWA. Comparisons for PSG vs SP sleep staging and the qualitative presence or absence of PSG-based RSWA vs automated SP-detected NRH was performed using kappa coefficients (</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><italic toggle="yes">k</italic></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive">), positive and negative percent agreements (PPA and NPA), and chi-square tests.</citation_analysis></p>

          <title>Results</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">The kappa scores from Sites-1 and −2 for PSG vs SP staging were different for Wake (</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><italic toggle="yes">k</italic></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">=0.82 vs 0.65), N2 (</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><italic toggle="yes">k</italic></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">=0.63 vs 0.72) and REM (</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><italic toggle="yes">k</italic></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">=0.83 vs.0.72). The by-site kappa values for stage N3 increased from 0.72 and 0.37 to 0.88 and 0.74 after PSG records were reedited. The kappa values for between-physician agreement in iRBD diagnoses were fair (k = 0.22). The agreement between each physician’s iRBD diagnoses and NRH were also fair (</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><italic toggle="yes">k</italic></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">=0.29 and 0.22). Abnormal NRH agreed with at least one physician’s iRBD diagnosis in 83% of the records. The PPA resulting from between-physician iRBD agreement was stronger and the NPA weaker than the values obtained from comparison of each physician’s iRBD diagnosis and abnormal NRH.</citation_analysis></p>

          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The potential utility of RSWA and stage N3 as neurodegenerative disorder biomarkers was influenced by between-site variability in visual scoring. The degree to which NRH was associated with iRBD was similar to the between-physician agreement in their diagnosis of iRBD using RSWA.</citation_analysis></p>

SP was accurate in its detection of REM and in the differentiation between stages N2 and N3 in patients suspected of iRBD. The biomarker NRH corresponded with physician’s diagnosis of iRBD based on detection of RSWA.
