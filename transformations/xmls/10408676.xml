          <title>Results</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">A total of 57 subjects were included, with an average age of 40.12±11.73 years, including 47 males (82.5%); 26 patients were in the telemedicine group, and 31 were in the control group. Follow-up results showed that the acceptance rate of APAP treatment was 57.7% and 54.8% in the telemedicine and control groups, respectively, with no significant difference between the two groups (p=0.829). The cost-benefit analysis showed that the telemedicine group reduced the cost of patients’ medical treatment [−457.84(−551.19,1466.87)] but increased the extra intervention frequency and time outside the doctor’s office. Further analysis showed that male subjects of older age, higher education level, distant residence, no fatty liver, poor sleep quality, severe insomnia, and higher OSA severity were more likely to receive telemedicine diagnosis and treatment.</citation_analysis></p>

          <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">The APAP treatment acceptance rate and compliance of OSA patients in the telemedicine group were similar to those in the control group, and the cost of patients’ medical treatment was reduced. However, telemedicine increases the frequency and duration of additional out-of-hospital interventions.</citation_analysis></p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is the most common sleep-disordered breathing characterized by repetitive airway collapses that could lead to multiple organ dysfunction, increased morbidity and mortality, and increased use of medical resources.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> At present, the continuous improvement in diagnosis rates does not meet the higher demand for healthcare, and the medical resources related to sleep, such as doctors, technicians, and health resources allocated to OSA, are insufficient.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> OSA management has not improved, and there is an urgent need to explore a new clinical diagnosis and treatment model to solve these problems.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">In recent years, with the continuous development of information technology, telemedicine has rapidly developed in long-term postoperative and chronic disease management, and related measures are also improving. Current studies on OSA telemedicine have primarily focused on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment compliance. Existing studies have shown that compared with conventional care,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> remote monitoring did not significantly improve adherence to CPAP therapy, but it increased outpatient attendance for OSA assessment, saved nursing time, and improved cost-effectiveness during follow-up.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6–9</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> There are also reports that adherence to positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy is significantly improved by providing patients with information on the Internet regarding their use of the treatment</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> CPAP remote monitoring and telemedicine may provide innovative and practical solutions for high-risk patients with OSA who are reluctant to receive treatment, allowing home care providers and physician resources to be allocated primarily to those most in need. The rate of CPAP treatment use is low due to different medical insurance payment systems in different countries, and it remains to be determined whether telemedicine can effectively improve the use rate for clinical diagnosis and treatment among patients with OSA.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Currently, telemedicine is not fully mature and is not widely used in clinical practice. The clinical and economic feasibilities of OSA management using telemedicine are unclear. The key to applying telemedicine in clinical practice is to explore the treatment acceptance rate and cost-benefit analysis of telemedicine in real-world OSA diagnosis and treatment and to establish a telemedicine model that ensures medical quality, a good cost-benefit ratio, and improved ventilator treatment compliance among patients with OSA. Therefore, our study compared the acceptance rate of APAP treatment and cost-effectiveness in clinical practice between telemedicine and control groups and observed patients’ compliance during follow-up in order to form a new model of integrated and remote monitoring, diagnosis, treatment, follow-up, and management of sleep disorders.</citation_analysis></p>

        <title>Population</title>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">From November 2021 to November 2022, 326 patients visited the sleep clinic for snoring. After communicating with the researchers, 57 patients met the inclusion criteria and participated in the study. In the telemedicine group, the diagnostic equipment was sent back to the hospital by mail, and treatments and follow-ups were carried out via a remote APP (Application) on video/phone. In the control group, the subjects went to the sleep clinic in person for face-to-face treatment. Only the researchers knew about the groups; the patients were only told about the group’s treatment and follow-up plans. Patients who did not meet the requirements or refused to participate were scheduled for routine clinical management. The inclusion criteria were 1) age 18–65 years; 2) visitation to a sleep center, snoring complaints, suspicion of sleep apnea, and requirement for portable sleep monitoring; 3) ability to complete scale assessment and interview on time; and 4) familiarity with the Internet and ability to communicate online without obstacles. The exclusion criteria were: 1) absence of questionnaire and follow-up data; 2) previous diagnosis of OSA, central sleep apnea, tidal breathing, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, or narcolepsy; 3) history of PAP therapy, surgery, and other OSA treatments, or current requirement for oxygen therapy; 4) frequent business trips, irregular working hours, and night shifts within six months; 5) organic diseases such as tumors and coronary artery disease, or mental diseases such as anxiety and depression; and 6) age &gt; 65 years or unfamiliarity with the Internet.</citation_analysis></p>

        <title>Randomization</title>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Participants who completed the baseline interview were randomly assigned (1:1) to either the control or telemedicine groups. Randomization was carried out using the random number table method. First, patient labels were randomly numbered. Then, starting from any row or column in the random number table, three digits were read as a random number and input under the number. Thereafter, all the random numbers selected were numbered from small to large (those with the same random numbers were numbered in the order of first hand) and recorded in the third line. We defined numbers 1–27 as the control group and 28–57 as the intervention group, thus completing the grouping. This procedure was performed by non-research-related personnel. The randomization numbers were sequenced and sealed in envelopes not opened until the subjects provided informed consent. The subjects could withdraw at any time during the study.</citation_analysis></p>

        <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">After their first visit, subjects in the two groups were monitored overnight with the Home Sleep Apnea Test (HSAT) device (Alice Nightone, PHILIPS, USA). The subjects in the telemedicine group watched the teaching video and learned on the remote APP we developed and completed the HSAT. The subjects in the control group received face-to-face guidance from the research doctor in the outpatient department. The next day, the telemedicine group mailed the HSAT back to the sleep center, and the control group sent it back in person. A study doctor downloaded the data and interpreted the results. Any unqualified records were rescheduled for monitoring. Sleep monitoring data were manually analyzed and interpreted by trained physicians following the American Academy of Sleep Medicine’s Manual of Interpretation of Sleep and Related Events standards.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> The Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) is the number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep.

        <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Patients willing to receive APAP were followed up for six months after purchase. The patients were followed up by experienced sleep doctors in the first week and after 1, 3, and 6 months of treatment. Follow-up included patients’ APAP compliance data (duration of use, pressure, air leakage, residual AHI, etc.), subjective feelings, snoring, and other symptom improvements. The APAP compliance data of the telemedicine group were uploaded to the ResMed Airview and PHILIPS Encore Anywhere platforms. Physicians downloaded patient data on the platform and followed up with the patients via a remote APP video/phone. Follow-up questionnaires were completed at the corresponding follow-up time points. Participants in the control group visited the sleep center in person for face-to-face follow-ups with a sleep doctor. The time and cost of visits were recorded at each follow-up, and visits and follow-ups outside the nodes were considered additional interventions.</citation_analysis></p>

        <title>Time/Economic Cost and Its Transformation</title>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">We considered both direct and indirect costs in our cost-benefit analysis. Direct costs included the salaries of the study physicians and all costs associated with follow-up visits, including masks, humidifiers, and medications used by the patients, as well as additional costs for visits to other specialized doctors, nurses, and emergency services. Non-directly related expenses refer to travel expenses incurred by patients during the study period. Indirect costs are the opportunity costs of lost productivity and work due to follow-up, and we also considered the time lost due to hospital visits and video conferencing.</citation_analysis></p>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">All time and financial costs incurred from the first visit till the end of follow-up in both groups were recorded through questioning and timing. Direct time spent related to OSA treatment included the first face-to-face visit with the sleep doctor (ask patient), the sleep doctor setting HSAT information for a patient and initializing the HSAT (record), informing the patient on how to use HSAT face-to-face/informing patient on how to watch the HSAT wearing and using video on the remote APP (record), downloading data and interpreting the HSAT (record), and arranging patient’s visit with the sleep doctor. Other aspects comprised outpatient face-to-face/video phone assessment after HSAT treatment (record), outpatient face-to-face/video phone interpretation of the HSAT report (record), preparation and setting of the APAP device (record), and face-to-face instruction of patients on how to use APAP/telling patients how to watch APAP wearing and using video on remote APP and matters needing attention (record). Outpatient face-to-face/remote follow-up (records), and outpatient/remote follow-up (records) at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after the ventilator data were downloaded from the program platform and home pressure titration was performed also comprised the direct time related to OSA treatment.

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">The demand for OSA treatment has increased with its rising incidence, and the consequences of its social and multiorgan damage have increased the economic burden on society.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> It has been reported that the cost of OSA diagnosis and treatment can reach up to US $12.4 billion.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Traditional diagnosis and treatment models find it difficult to meet the huge needs regarding the diagnosis, treatment, and chronic disease management of OSA. Therefore, remote management has emerged. Although professional societies such as the American Medical Association of Sleep Medicine have issued guidelines for the standardized diagnosis, treatment, and management of adult OSA, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis, standardized treatment, and long-term management of OSA,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> the practice of remote management is still limited and has not been widely promoted, especially in Asian countries. Some studies have evaluated CPAP compliance with remote management,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> and the compliance and effectiveness of patients with OSA with CPAP under telemedicine guidance and monitoring are not inferior to traditional outpatient medical treatment. However, it is unclear if telemedicine is accepted by patients, which is an important factor hindering the practice of telemedicine in China. Further evidence is needed for the clinical evaluation of the remote management model to guide practice.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Our results showed that the APAP treatment acceptance rate of the telemedicine group was not inferior to that of the control group, indicating that telemedicine is effective and feasible for OSA diagnosis and treatment. Verbraecken points out that telemedicine may be cost-effective, but better evidence is needed. Although barriers to implementation remain, telemedicine is feasible, but its use is at the discretion of doctors and patients.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Most foreign studies have evaluated CPAP compliance, but in China, CPAP treatment is not supported by medical insurance, and patients pay for it themselves. Our study showed that telemedicine did not affect the rate of APAP treatment for patients with OSA and was not inferior to traditional medical treatment in terms of patient self-payment, demonstrating its meaningfulness and feasibility in clinical practice.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Our study found that the telemedicine and control groups had similar APAP use adherence. The analysis of factors influencing compliance found that the ESS score was correlated with APAP compliance, with treatment compliance increasing with an increase in ESS score. Bruyneel et al</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> found that CPAP adherence was related to AHI and ESS scores. This is consistent with our findings. However, existing studies have failed to reach a consensus regarding whether telemedicine can improve treatment compliance in patients with OSA. Recently, Murphie et al</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> systematically reviewed the role of telemonitoring-related teleconsultation in the follow-up of patients with OSA. The results of studies on CPAP compliance were mixed. Two studies showed that the compliance regarding CPAP was similar in the remote and traditional monitoring groups,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> which was also consistent with the results of our study. Three other smaller studies reported slight improvements in CPAP adherence with remote monitoring.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20–22</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Sparrow et al</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> randomly assigned 250 patients who started CPAP therapy to the telephone follow-up and routine outpatient groups for 12 months of treatment. Although the remote follow-up group showed a small degree of improvement in compliance, the overall compliance was generally low. However, in an RCT involving 60 subjects, Chumpangern et al</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> provided remote telephone intervention guidance to subjects with poor CPAP use for two consecutive nights. The results showed that the average time of CPAP use per night in the remote intervention subjects significantly increased, and treatment compliance significantly improved. Overall, most studies differ on the effects of telemedicine on CPAP compliance, possibly owing to differences in study sample sizes and design methods.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Despite the decline in the cost of information and communication technologies, cost-effectiveness issues associated with telemedicine remain critical. Our study showed that the telemedicine group was more cost-effective. Two recent research teams evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the remote follow-up of patients treated with CPAP. In the first study, 139 CPAP patients were randomly assigned to tele-follow-up (telemonitoring and teleconsultation) or usual care for six months of therapeutic follow-up. The results showed that remote follow-up was more cost-effective, with lower cost despite more visits, and no significant difference in compliance.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> In the second study,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> 100 CPAP patients were randomly assigned to receive remote monitoring or regular care for three months, and researchers found that remote monitoring was more cost-effective. Both studies support the cost-effectiveness of telemedicine for CPAP patients, and the same conclusions were confirmed in our study. However, the research subjects of our study were all from the same province. This telemedicine model may be even more cost-effective if applied to remote areas or people with busy or fixed working hours. The cost reduction brought about by the telemedicine model is not only reflected in transportation, accommodation, and leave time. It is also greatly reduced by transforming the diagnosis method from expensive polysomnography to portable home sleep monitoring devices. The follow-up in the treatment process has changed from the original outpatient registration face-to-face follow-up to remote APP video follow-up. This reduces the cost of medical treatment for patients in all stages. However, our study found that additional intervention times were needed in the telemedicine group, while the visits and follow-up nodes were fixed for the traditional group. Due to the convenience of the network, patients would take the initiative to seek doctors’ help without limit, which increased doctors’ additional consultation time for telemedicine subjects. These extra interventions and follow-ups were not included in the clinical treatment. If this part is free, it increases the work burden of doctors outside the hospital, and the current medical service does not meet such needs.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Currently, optimizing OSA treatment strategies requires assigning patients to specific phenotypes and proposing personalized treatment strategies for these subtypes.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Remote monitoring of CPAP and telemedicine may provide innovative and practical solutions to identify patients with OSA at the highest risk for non-adherence in the future, thereby allocating physician resources to those most in need. A multicenter RCT of 206 patients with symptomatic OSA but without serious comorbidities and at low cardiovascular risk found that telemonitoring did not achieve better ventilator compliance than conventional monitoring and that the follow-up workload of physicians and home care providers was significantly increased in the telemonitoring group. The above mentioned study suggests that remote monitoring has less of an impact on symptomatic people with low cardiovascular risk. Our results showed that male subjects of older age, higher education level, farther distance, no fatty liver, poor sleep quality, a higher degree of insomnia, and heavier OSA were more likely to receive remote diagnosis and treatment, which also provides a reference for the accurate selection of the OSA population in future clinical applications of telemedicine.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">This study has some limitations. Firstly, the sample size of the patients included in this study was small because of the coronavirus pandemic, and the expected sample size was not obtained. Secondly, the study was only verified in a single center, leading to the possibility that some results could not be verified in different centers. In addition, the source of outpatients was limited, the subjects were randomized in Guangdong Province, and their working and family locations were limited. Therefore, the applicability of the research results in remote areas or non-first-tier cities needs to be further studied.</citation_analysis></p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Our study found that APAP treatment acceptance rates in telemedicine were similar to those in traditional treatment, and there was no difference in treatment compliance. Telemedicine is more cost-effective but adds extra intervention time and time for doctors, which limits the application of telemedicine in clinical practice.</citation_analysis></p>
