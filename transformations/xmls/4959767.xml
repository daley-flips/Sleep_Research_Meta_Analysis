          <title>Background</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">In obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), occlusion of the upper airway by soft tissue causes intermittent hypoxemia and can have serious sequelae. A novel implantable medical device for OSA is composed of a linear silicone elastic element held in an extended state by a bioabsorbable external sheath. The implant is delivered to the tongue base or soft palate via a minimally invasive approach. Normal tissue healing anchors the device at the attachment points before the bioabsorbable material dissolves and the elastic element contracts to stabilize the surrounding tissue.</citation_analysis></p>

          <title>Methods</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Device prototypes were evaluated in multiple investigations: 1) a finite elements analysis model simulated the movement of the tongue base during sleep with and without the implant; 2) dynamic mechanical testing simulated 10 years’ normal use; 3) cadaveric implantations were conducted; 4) an ovine study in which implants of varying design were evaluated via gross pathology and histological assessment; and 5) a canine study in which implants of varying design in the tongue base and soft palate were evaluated via gross pathology and histological assessment.</citation_analysis></p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">1) The implant was capable of reducing ~95% of tongue base movement during simulated sleep; 2) implants remained intact throughout the testing with no evidence of creep fatigue or change in dynamic modulus; 3) the device could be reliably deployed in the desired placement locations and was appropriate for various anatomies; and 4) all implants were well tolerated through 1 year, with minimal inflammatory responses.</citation_analysis></p>

          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">This new minimally invasive device for OSA has been demonstrated, through various bench and animal testing, to be safe, well tolerated, suitable for long-term use, and to function as intended. No adverse health consequences were observed in the animals, and histological evaluation indicated good healing. This study establishes proof of concept and supports human trials.</citation_analysis></p>

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">A novel medical device has been designed to be surgically implanted into the tongue base and palate via a minimally invasive approach in order to prevent collapse of those tissues into the airway that can result in OSA. This study describes the studies that were conducted to refine the prototype’s design and confirm critical attributes prior to device evaluation in a human population. The device was evaluated via multiple methods: computer modeling, mechanical and fatigue testing, cadaveric implantation tests, and preclinical assessments in animal models.

        <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Prototype devices were developed. Critical attributes considered during device design included long-term biocompatibility of all materials, lifetime stability of the device elements, ease of implantation, ease of removal (if desired), and most importantly, sufficient strength to provide soft tissue support but sufficient elasticity to allow for normal speech and swallowing without any awareness of the device. Additional design considerations included ease and reproducibility of manufacture, use of well-accepted and readily available biomaterials, and compatibility of the device with other OSA interventions.</citation_analysis></p>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">The initial design concept consisted of a linear silicone elastic element wrapped with a bioabsorbable material to keep it in an extended state. Attachment points at each end of the linear element allow self-anchoring of the device via the normal tissue healing response before the bioabsorbable material slowly dissolves, allowing the elastic element to contract and stabilize the surrounding tissue. Implant delivery involves a minimally invasive procedure of creating a tissue tunnel with the introducer (a stainless steel trocar) in the tongue base via submental incision or in the soft palate, and guiding the implant into place through the introducer via the pusher, a stainless steel rod that delivers the implant (</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-nss-8-249">Figure 1</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">).

        <title>Computer modeling</title>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Computer modeling was used to simulate the movement of the tongue base during sleep with and without the implant. Complexities are often encountered in modeling soft tissue. First, the tissue is nonlinear – it does not react in one-to-one correspondence of force and motion. Second, although excised tissue from many sources has been well characterized, obtaining precise physical parameters for in vivo tissue is difficult. Third, there is an unavoidable variability from individual to individual. However, these issues can be addressed using finite element analysis (FEA), a numerical method used to analyze stresses and strains within structures and other physical problems such as those involving heat, fluid flow, and electromagnetic systems.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="b18-nss-8-249" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> With accurate descriptors of material properties and loads, realistic representations can be obtained by solving a set of equations representing the system in finite steps by dividing the physical representation into many small elements that can be more easily handled.

        <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Implants (various lengths with an elastic modulus of ~2 N/mm</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><sup>2</sup></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive">) were then introduced into the construct and forced to contract by 30%. The physical displacement of the tongue base construct due to gravity was again observed; differences from the baseline displacements were attributed to the implant. The implant’s insertion site, trajectory, and distal termination point were hypothesized to be relevant elements to the implant’s effect on baseline displacement. Therefore, before contraction, implant placement was varied according to the implant’s modeled insertion site and trajectory (a high sublingual site with a shallow angle of insertion vs a low submental site with an acute angle of insertion vs a midpoint of the two), and outcomes were compared. The effectiveness of the implant was also compared with the distal end terminating inside the tongue base away from the oropharyngeal surface of the tongue vs near to the oropharyngeal surface of the tongue (</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-nss-8-249">Figure 2</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">).

        <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Analysis of the soft palate and tongue base systems indicates that the highest stress on either system is caused by the force exerted on the tongue base during swallowing. During swallowing, the tongue moves in the posterior direction, closing the oropharynx. The range of dimensions for the oropharynx is estimated to be between 11 mm and 14 mm,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="b30-nss-8-249" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">–</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="b34-nss-8-249" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> and the movement of the tongue during swallowing is ~10 mm.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="b35-nss-8-249" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Swallowing causes an implant positioned in the tongue base to stretch, thus imparting a tensile force on the implant. The maximum expected in vivo stretch of an implant was estimated based on the range of oropharyngeal dimensions documented in the literature, assuming a conservative model in which the implant stretches only along its axis and is rigidly fixed at the proximal position. An endurance value of 5,256,000 stretch cycles was set based on the assumption of 1 swallow/min for 10 years.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="b36-nss-8-249" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></citation_analysis></p>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Mechanical testing was conducted after sterilization (irradiation) and simulated shipping. Aged (2 years) and nonaged implants were stretched in the axial direction to at least 150% of their fully contracted length. The implants were inspected for gross failure, defined as any failure or fracture that could be seen under 5× magnification. Displacement-controlled dynamic cycle fatigue testing was conducted on implants in 1× phosphate-buffered saline at 37°C±3°C to simulate body conditions. The specimens were held by the test actuator and stretched axially to 150% of their contracted length. The specimens were then displaced cyclically by the actuator an additional fixed percentage at a cyclic displacement rate of 5 Hz using constant sinusoidal displacement amplitude control. Testing was terminated when the specimen reached the endurance value of 5,256,000 cycles or experienced failure. Before and after testing, the body length of each sample was measured, and the samples were subjected to a static axial tension test in which load and displacement data were collected. Every 100,000 cycles, dynamic stiffness (force/displacement) was calculated by capturing the peak and valley values from both the force and displacement sine waves. Every 1,000,000 cycles, macroscopic checks were performed and body length was measured. The failure mode of each specimen and the corresponding cycle count were recorded.</citation_analysis></p>

At 1 month, 2 months, or 6 months postimplantation, animals were euthanized, and the devices and surrounding muscle tissue were excised en bloc. In addition, in two animals at 6 months postimplantation, tests of the strength of implant attachment were completed by exposing the center section of the implant and pulling on the implant ends. Implant/tissue samples were formalin fixed by immersion. Approximately half of the devices were examined for gross pathology and implant attachment quality, whereas the other half were submitted for histological evaluation. For this, longitudinal or transverse sections were taken at 5 µm from the attachment element on each end of the implant and in the center of the implant through the erodible and elastic elements (two sections at each location). Sections were then dehydrated through gradient alcohol concentrations, cleared in xylene, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and evaluated under light microscopy. Inflammation and resorption of the PLG erodible element were evaluated.</citation_analysis></p>

Histology samples included high- and low-durometer silicone and all formulations of PLG. Inflammation was graded on a scale of 1–5 (1= minimal and 5= overt abscess formation), and resorption of the PLG erodible element was graded on a scale of 0–4 (0= none or negligible material persistent in tissue [completely resorbed] and 4= material persistent in tissue largely intact [nonresorbed]). Histological analysis was confirmed by an independent secondary reviewer. The remaining implants (n=36) were evaluated for healing, gross pathology, and degree of attachment at various intervals between 2 months and 10 months postimplantation.

        <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Without an implant (control), the base of the tongue was modeled to move 7.3 mm toward the posterior pharyngeal wall due to the gravitational and breathing disorder-related forces when in the supine position. With an implant, the tongue displacement due to gravity was reduced. All permutations of implant insertion site and termination point of the distal end relative to the oropharyngeal surface of the tongue base showed some degree of displacement effectiveness. Insertion of the device from a sublingual site was least effective at reducing displacement, whereas a low submental insertion point was most effective. In addition, tissue stabilization was greatest when the distal end of the implant terminated near the surface of the tongue base (ie, traversing the entire tongue base instead of terminating in the belly of the muscle).</citation_analysis></p>

        <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Representative samples of new and aged implant specimens were stretched to failure in order to verify tensile holding force, elongation, and ultimate break force. All implants exceeded 150% elongation, with no observed failure as a result of the stretching until well past that level. For dynamic testing, all specimens remained intact through 5,265,000 stretch cycles, with no evidence of gross failure. There was no change in implant body length (no creep fatigue) throughout the 5,265,000 cycles. Additionally, there was virtually no change in dynamic modulus after the full test battery (</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-nss-8-249">Figure 3</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">).</citation_analysis></p>

          <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">All implants were well tolerated by the animals. Both single-hole loop and paddle-shaped attachment points showed excellent encapsulation with fibrous tissue. The single-hole loop design was the easiest to remove by cutting either the loop material or the tissue column that had formed in the loop center. There was no need for additional dissection with the single-hole loop design, whereas removal of all other attachment element designs required some cutting of the adjacent tissue.</citation_analysis></p>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">There was little inflammation at any of the attachment points or in the middle of the linear implant at any time points; inflammation was characterized by small numbers of multinucleated giant cells, consistent with a foreign body reaction (</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-nss-8-249">Figure 4</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive">). The fast-eroding PLG was significantly reabsorbed by 30 days and completely resorbed by 60 days, allowing the device to contract and exert tensile force on the target tissue.

          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Of the 66 devices implanted, there were three complications: one palate implant was missing at 3 weeks, one palate implant was exposed at 10 months, and one tongue implant showed an abscess around the implant at 3.5 months. All other implants were well tolerated by the animals and showed excellent healing and fibrous tissue attachment. There were minimal inflammatory responses at the ends or middle of the implants with the exception of the tongue implant that was assessed at 3.5 months and found to have an abscess with histological evidence of infection and a second tongue implant that was assessed at 6 months and found to have localized suppurative exudate at one end. The former device had been difficult to insert and the latter device was folded upon itself, suggesting difficulty in placement. Both of these infections were discovered upon histological evaluation; no evidence of infection in vivo had been apparent and as such no treatment (ie, antibiotics) had been given to the animals.</citation_analysis></p>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">In general, inflammation was slightly greater around the erodible element relative to the attachment element, likely due to the PLG material stimulating a low-grade foreign body response as the material undergoes degradation and is removed from the tissue. Inflammation reduced over time. As expected, the rate of resorption of PLG material was a factor of its formulation (fast-, medium-, or slow-eroding), and the degree of foreign-body inflammation was related to the amount of residual PLG in the target tissue. Although the fast-eroding PLG formulation was resorbed most quickly, all formulations of PLG material were fully resorbed, with no residual material, by 365 days. Virtually, all implants were well tolerated with no excessive inflammation or evidence of progressive or dissecting fibrosis after a year. Tensile strength (silicone durometer) appeared to have negligible effect on inflammation or PLG erosion (</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-nss-8-249">Table 2</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">).</citation_analysis></p>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">In four cases, the implant site was examined after the earlier removal of the implant followed by 6 weeks or 16 weeks of healing. All sites showed excellent healing. Fibrosis and inflammation were minor, and when noted, were limited to small regions of 2–3 mm, which would not be expected to have clinical consequences.</citation_analysis></p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">A novel implanted device for the management of OSA was developed. The linear elastic implant is held in its extended state with bioabsorbable PLG; shortly after implantation in the tongue base or soft palate through a minimally invasive procedure, fibrous tissue infiltration into the ends of the implant anchors it in place. The PLG erodes over time, allowing the implant to contract and to apply tensile force onto the target tissue to retract the tongue and/or palate, expanding the oropharyngeal opening and/or reducing the degree of airway collapse during sleep. The implant is not expected to interfere with swallowing or other tongue function due to its flexibility and elasticity.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Computer modeling demonstrated that the implants are likely to be effective in vivo. When the FEA tongue model described in this study was used (which simulated gravitational and sleep disordered breathing-related forces during sleep in the supine position), the tongue base displaced 7.3 mm into the oropharyngeal opening without an implant. Given that the glossopharyngeal airway has an average cross-section of ~25 mm</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><sup>2</sup></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="b37-nss-8-249" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> this displacement would likely represent a clinically relevant occlusion. The introduction of a tongue base implant (in its fully attached and contracted state) applied an “internal retractor” to reduce the amount of tongue displacement. This is similar to the “pneumatic splinting” achieved by CPAP: at high pressure (15 cmH</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><sub>2</sub></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">O) the anterior–posterior midregion airway dimension is increased.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="b38-nss-8-249" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> The effectiveness of the implant, however, was strongly dependent on its physical location in the tongue base. We determined that implants deployed at a low submental entry point were more effective than those deployed from a high, sublingual entry point. Similarly, the ultimate site of the distal end of the implant was also important: tissue stabilization was greatest when the distal end of the implant terminated near the surface of the tongue base.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Most materials have a finite fatigue life when repeatedly stressed; this may eventually weaken the material and lead to failure. Therefore, mechanical testing was conducted to demonstrate the ability of a device to maintain its integrity during shipping, storage, implantation, and in vivo regarding its suitability as a long-term implant. Fatigue testing demonstrated that the fatigue life of the device is greater than the expected use life. For silicone polymers, failure may consist of rupture of the device or elongation due to creep fatigue. Static testing showed that implants were able to be stretched to at least 150% of their contracted length. Dynamic testing designed to approximate the stresses likely to be applied to the implant during swallowing was conducted for the equivalent of 10 years of usage. There was virtually no change in the implant’s dynamic modulus after the full test battery, suggesting that the elasticity of the implant was fully maintained and that the implants are likely able to endure substantially longer cycles than tested. Together, this information suggests that deployed implants are unlikely to interfere with tongue motion and are also unlikely to fail due to tongue motion in vivo.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Placement of the implants into cadavers showed that the implants and the delivery system functioned as expected and were not damaged during the implantation process. Moreover, the cadaver work demonstrated that the device and delivery system were compatible with a broad range of human anatomies and with the anticipated user population, surgical environment, and surgical tools.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Testing in animals confirmed the feasibility of the implant process; very few difficulties were encountered. The ovine study involved implanting devices with various versions of attachment point structures into the dorsal trunk musculature, which approximates the tongue muscle in the humans and canines. The study showed that the implants are well tolerated and are easily anchored through normal tissue healing. The single-hole silicone loop attachment element proved to be the superior option, due to its greater consistency of attachment appearance relative to the other configurations in the histological analysis. The relatively large diameter hole in this configuration allows consistent attachment of fibrous tissue across the device, anchoring it into the muscle tissue. Furthermore, because this design was also found to be the easiest to manufacture, deploy, and remove after anchoring, it was selected for further study in canines. The canine study generated information regarding the local tissue response to devices sited in the tongue and palate. The study confirmed good biocompatibility, complete anchoring of the devices, easy removal (with no histological evidence of tissue trauma weeks later), and a low degree of inflammation. The results demonstrate that the implant is biocompatible in the tongue of dogs through 1 year.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">In both animal studies, there was generally a minimal to mild low-grade foreign body-type response typical of any implanted device. The inflammation was localized to the device interface and considered to be fully biocompatible. Inflammation was slightly more prominent for devices with residual PLG material and appeared dependent on the amount of residual PLG persisting in the tissue. This is an expected consequence of bioabsorbable materials of this type and is transient.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="b39-nss-8-249" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Indeed, where PLG was completely resorbed, inflammation was minimal. The medium-eroding PLG formulation emerged as the best option in the animal tests because it underwent significant hydrolysis and bioabsorption at the 30-day time point, as evidenced by the pronounced crumbling that was apparent histologically, and was essentially resorbed by 60 days. In contrast, the slow-eroding PLG formulation persisted to a significant degree through 60 days and maintained most of the coiled structural integrity around the extended silicone elastomer, and the fast-eroding PLG formulation was completely resorbed at 60 days. Thus, the medium-eroding PLG allowed the tensile forces of the implant to be deployed as intended in the target tissue shortly after fibrous attachment was achieved. Silicone of different durometers and erodible elements of different PLG ratios all appeared equally safe and effective; differences in these materials are likely to show only minor variations in clinical results.</citation_analysis></p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">A new implantable device for the management of OSA has been demonstrated through computer modeling, mechanical bench testing, cadaver implantations, and animal implantations to be safe, well tolerated, and to function as intended. Stress testing supports the robustness of the device and suitability for long-term use. No adverse health consequences or other complications related to the implants were observed in the trunk of the sheep or in the tongue or palate of the dogs. Histological evaluation indicated good healing response for the tissue surrounding the implants. The device is implanted in a minimally invasive procedure and can be nontraumatically removed. This study establishes proof of concept as well as preclinical safety and stability, and suggests preliminary guidelines for implantation procedures in humans. The device has been adapted for human use; results of clinical studies are described separately.</citation_analysis></p>

The – indicates samples with abscesses that were excluded from the data set for the purposes of statistical evaluation to remove bias from infection at the implant site, as the abscess was considered to be secondary to infection at the site and not a true reflection of the tissue response in the uncomplicated state. Inflammation was graded on a scale of 1–5 (1= minimal and 5= overt abscess formation), and resorption of the PLG erodible element was graded on a scale of 0–4 (0= none or negligible material persistent in tissue [completely resorbed] and 4= material persistent in tissue largely intact [nonresorbed]).</citation_analysis></p>
