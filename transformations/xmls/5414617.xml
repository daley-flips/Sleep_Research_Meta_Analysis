        <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Narcolepsy is a neurological disease that affects 1 in 2,000 individuals and is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). In 60–70% of individuals with narcolepsy, it is also characterized by cataplexy or a sudden loss of muscle tone that is triggered by positive or negative emotions. Narcolepsy decreases the quality of life of the afflicted individuals. Currently used drugs treat EDS alone (modafinil/armodafinil, methylphenidate, and amphetamine), cataplexy alone (“off-label” use of antidepressants), or both EDS and cataplexy (sodium oxybate). These drugs have abuse, tolerability, and adherence issues. A greater diversity of drug options is needed to treat narcolepsy.

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Narcolepsy is a disease that affects 1 in 2,000 individuals in North America and Europe. These individuals suffer from excessive daytime sleepiness, and some also experience cataplexy or sudden loss of muscle control. These symptoms of narcolepsy cause a significant decrease in the quality of life for these narcoleptic individuals. There are limited drug options for narcoleptic individuals, and the drugs available have side effects that might be intolerable. Recent evidence suggests that activating neurons that release histamine in the brain can treat the symptoms of narcolepsy. The drug, pitolisant, has been shown to activate histaminergic neurons. This review focuses on the clinical outcomes of pitolisant, the newest drug approved for the treatment of the symptoms of narcolepsy.</citation_analysis></p>

        <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Current pharmacotherapies focus on alleviating EDS or, when present, cataplexy, or both. Only one drug, sodium oxybate, is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat both EDS and cataplexy. Sodium oxybate is often well tolerated and does improve the quality of life of narcoleptic patients. However, sodium oxybate has abuse potential due to its anxiolytic, hypnotic and euphoric effects,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="b9-nss-9-127" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> and has possible neurotoxic side effects.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="b1-nss-9-127" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Sodium oxybate, due to its short half-life, must be taken in a split dose, once at bedtime and again 2.5–4 hours later. Consequently, sodium oxybate treatment adherence is difficult. Other FDA-approved treatments for narcolepsy treat EDS only. The first-, second-, and third-line treatments for EDS in narcoleptic patients are modafinil/armodafinil, methylphenidate, and amphetamine, respectively. The first is preferred due to low abuse potential and lack of sympathomimetic side effects compared with the latter two, which are categorized as stimulants of the central nervous system. To treat cataplexy in narcoleptic individuals, antidepressants have been prescribed “off-label.” However, there are no clinical trials on the efficacy or safety of antidepressants in the treatment of cataplexy.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="b1-nss-9-127" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> These drugs may also be combined to improve patient outcomes.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="b10-nss-9-127" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="negative"> Due to the scarcity of viable treatments for narcolepsy with or without cataplexy, there is a pressing need to develop new pharmacotherapies for this disease that affects 1 in 2,000 individuals.</citation_analysis></p>

Compared to baseline (before start of drug administration) and to placebo, pitolisant significantly decreases ESS scores by &gt;4 points. However, those treated with pitolisant still had an average ESS score of &gt;11, suggesting that these individuals were still moderately sleepy. The authors of this study did note that 9 of the 21 patients “normalized” their ESS scores below 11 (ESS responders). Individuals taking pitolisant decreased the number of diurnal sleep episodes as well as duration when compared to placebo.

The modafinil treatment group was included to test the noninferiority of pitolisant to modafinil, a standard treatment for EDS in narcolepsy. This study lasted for 8 weeks with the first 3 weeks using a flexible dosing regimen (pitolisant: 10, 20, or 40 mg and modafinil: 100, 200, or 400 mg), followed by 5 weeks of stable dosing.

Sixty-one percent of the individuals were considered cataplectic during the trial. Thirty-five percent of the individuals were taking anticataplectic drugs before the trial and remained on those drugs during this trial. Pitolisant and modafinil had improvements in ESS scores compared to placebo, and pitolisant was not noninferior compared to modafinil. The rate of ESS score decrease during the 8-week trial was similar in the pitolisant and modafinil groups. Moreover, there was a higher percentage of narcoleptic individuals taking pitolisant who normalized their ESS scores (ESS score ≤ 10) compared to placebo; pitolisant was not different compared to modafinil to normalize ESS scores. MWT scores also showed significant improvement in the pitolisant and modafinil groups compared to placebo; there was no difference between the pitolisant and modafinil treatment groups. Compared with placebo, the error scores for SART significantly improved with pitolisant and modafinil with no differences between pitolisant and modafinil. Daily rate of cataplexy, as derived from sleep diaries, significantly improved compared to placebo. Modafinil failed to decrease cataplectic symptoms compared to placebo; however, there was no difference in cataplectic rates between modafinil and pitolisant. This suggests that pitolisant might be superior to modafinil in the treatment of cataplectic symptoms. All treatment groups reported adverse events. For all three groups, headache was reported. For pitolisant, insomnia, abdominal discomfort, and nausea, while for modafinil, abdominal discomfort and nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, anxiety, and irritability were reported. Once again, a limitation of this study was that PSGs were not completed to objectively quantify any changes in sleep architecture, sleep duration, or sleep efficiency.</citation_analysis></p>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">This same group published a more recent randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled study on the safety and efficacy of pitolisant to decrease cataplexy in 105 narcoleptic individuals, with 54 individuals assigned to the pitolisant treatment group and 51 individuals assigned to the placebo group.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="b21-nss-9-127" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> The treatment period lasted for 7 weeks, with the first 3 weeks of flexible dosing to increase or decrease pitolisant (5, 10, 20, or 40 mg) or placebo concentration, followed by 4 weeks of stable dosing. During the treatment period, five patients in the pitolisant group and nine patients in the placebo group discontinued treatment due to protocol deviation, lack of efficacy, lack of efficacy and adverse event, or for no reason given. Forty-nine patients taking pitolisant and 42 patients taking placebo completed the study. The primary end point was the change in average number of cataplexy attacks per week at the end of the treatment period compared to baseline (2 weeks before starting the treatment) as recorded in individual diaries. Cataplexy attacks were defined as sudden and transient episodes of partial or generalized loss of muscle tone. Secondary end points were ESS and MWT scores and number of hallucinations recorded in individual diaries. Patients taking pitolisant decreased their weekly cataplexy rate by 75% from baseline levels, while the placebo group decreased their rate by 38% from baseline levels. The difference between the pitolisant and placebo change in weekly cataplexy was significant. This study included 12 individuals (N = 4 in the pitolisant treatment group; N = 8 in the placebo group) who kept taking other anticataplectic medication (eg, sodium oxybate or antidepressants) during the drug trial, and the effect of pitolisant was unchanged.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="b21-nss-9-127" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Hallucinations, a symptom of narcolepsy,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="b1-nss-9-127" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> also decreased with pitolisant treatment.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="b21-nss-9-127" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Similar to previous literature,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="b20-nss-9-127" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> pitolisant had a greater improvement in ESS and MWT scores from baseline than placebo, and more of the patients on pitolisant decreased their ESS score ≤ 10 (ESS responders).</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="b21-nss-9-127" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> The number of patients reporting adverse events did not differ between the groups,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="b21-nss-9-127" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> and reported adverse events were similar in previous reports.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="b20-nss-9-127" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> There was no difference in adverse event intensity and recovery between the pitolisant and placebo groups.

        <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Another study used pitolisant off-label to treat narcolepsy in four teenagers who were refractory to available treatments, including modafinil, methylphenidate, sodium oxybate, and amphetamine. Dosage of pitolisant was started at 10 mg, and dosage increased to 40 mg if clinical efficacy was not achieved. One teenager remained on an anticataplectic drug. Measurements were obtained from an Adapted ESS for EDS, Cataplexy Severity Rating Score (CSRS) for severity of cataplexy, and MWT for the ability to stay awake. The adapted ESS scores significantly decreased &lt;10 using pitolisant alone. However, authors decreased the adapted ESS scores further by combining pitolisant treatment with other EDS decreasing drugs in three of the teenagers. In three teenagers, the cataplectic attacks decreased in severity. A strength of this small study was that PSGs were conducted before and after pitolisant treatment, and there were no significant differences in sleep measurements. Minor adverse effects of pitolisant were observed only during the first week of treatment and included insomnia, headache, hot flashes, leg pain, and hallucinations.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="b22-nss-9-127" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></citation_analysis></p>

        <title>Pitolisant as a potential new drug treatment for narcolepsy</title>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Current published data on the treatment of narcolepsy with pitolisant, a small molecule acting as an antagonist/inverse agonist at the H</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><sub>3</sub></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> receptor subtype, are promising. In this review, there are four peer-reviewed published trials, two conference abstracts, and five ongoing or unpublished clinical trials investigating the efficacy of pitolisant to treat EDS and/or cataplexy in narcolepsy. The three placebo-controlled experiments, all conducted by the same group of investigators, recruited adults from multiple sites in Europe with similar demographics and baseline characteristics, making the data very homogenous. This same group of investigators also presented the abstracts and conducted the ongoing clinical trials. Other investigators need to conduct high-quality clinical trials to replicate the findings not only in demographics and baseline characteristics that are similar to the reported studies but also in differing demographics and baseline characteristics. Some data already exist with the open-label trial of pitolisant to treat narcolepsy in teenagers rather than adults, and there are ongoing trials in narcoleptic children. Still, pitolisant shows significant improvements in ESS and MWT scores and a decrease in cataplexy severity and rate over placebo with few adverse events. However, adverse events are still present and may lead to discontinuation of pitolisant as a treatment. The question remains whether or not pitolisant is more efficacious with less adverse events than the current treatments available to treat narcolepsy. Only one drug, sodium oxybate, has been approved to treat both EDS and cataplexy, and it is very well tolerated. However, the dosing regimen of sodium oxybate necessitates twice-nightly administration and can be difficult to adhere to for patients. Other drugs, like modafinil/armodafinil, methylphenidate, and amphetamine, treat only the EDS and have tolerability issues and/or abuse potential. Finally, antidepressants have been used “off-label” to treat cataplexy, but with no RCTs on their use, it is difficult to state if antidepressants are beneficial. These drugs have been combined to improve efficacy. Pitolisant has been shown to be equal in its efficacy to treat EDS compared to modafinil. There have been no studies published yet to show if pitolisant can be equal in its efficacy to decrease cataplexy compared to sodium oxybate. Larger studies, which are being completed, will further elucidate the potential of pitolisant as a treatment for narcolepsy.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="b16-nss-9-127" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> These studies will also clarify whether pitolisant in combination with other narcoleptic drugs can improve symptoms of narcolepsy.

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Clinical data from four trials using pitolisant to treat EDS and cataplexy in narcolepsy show promising results. These promising results of pitolisant increase the options that narcoleptic patients have to treat their disease. Currently, pitolisant is only approved in Europe to treat narcolepsy. Further studies are needed to gage the long-term efficacy of pitolisant to treat EDS and cataplexy in narcolepsy.</citation_analysis></p>
