          <title>Patients and Methods</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Data were collected during treatment titration and optimization in a phase 3 randomized withdrawal trial in adults (18–75 years of age) with idiopathic hypersomnia who took LXB treatment (once, twice, or thrice nightly, administered orally) in the OLT (10–14 weeks), followed by the 2-week, open-label SDP. Endpoints included the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Idiopathic Hypersomnia Severity Scale (IHSS), Patient Global Impression of Change, Clinical Global Impression of Change, Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ)-10, and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Specific Health Problem (WPAI:SHP).</citation_analysis></p>

        <sec id="s2003">
          <title>Results</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The safety population included 154 participants; the modified intent-to-treat population comprised 115 participants. During open-label treatment, mean (SD) ESS scores improved (decreased) from 15.7 (3.8) at baseline to 6.1 (4.0) at end of SDP, and IHSS scores improved (decreased) from 31.6 (8.3) to 15.3 (8.5). Improvements were also observed during OLT in each individual IHSS item and in FOSQ-10 and WPAI:SHP scores. Thirty-five (22.7%) participants discontinued during OLT and SDP, 22 (14.3%) due to treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) during OLT and SDP. The most frequent TEAEs in the first 4 weeks were nausea, headache, dizziness, and dry mouth; TEAE incidence decreased throughout OLT and SDP (weeks 1–4, n = 87 [56.5%]; weeks 13–16, n = 39 [31.7%]).</citation_analysis></p>

      <title>Plain Language Summary</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Idiopathic hypersomnia is a sleep disorder that causes daytime sleepiness. Many patients also have difficulty awakening, long sleep time at night, long and unrefreshing naps, and problems thinking clearly. Lower-sodium oxybate is a medicine used to treat symptoms of idiopathic hypersomnia.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">This research was done to understand how lower-sodium oxybate affected idiopathic hypersomnia symptoms in participants beginning treatment in the first 2 parts of a clinical trial (NCT03533114; EUDRACT: 2018-001311-79). First, participants adjusted to lower-sodium oxybate until they found a best dose (for 10–14 weeks). Next, they took the same best dose for 2 weeks (stable-dose period). Participants knew they were taking lower-sodium oxybate during this time. Participants’ idiopathic hypersomnia symptoms, quality of life, functioning, working ability, sleep time, and side effects were measured.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Lower-sodium oxybate improved their sleepiness and other symptoms of idiopathic hypersomnia. Participants reported that their quality of life improved and they were better able to function and work. About 20% of participants left the trial early, and in total, 14% left because of side effects. The most common side effects in the first 4 weeks were nausea, headache, dizziness, and dry mouth. Side effects happened less often as the trial went on.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">These results show that lower-sodium oxybate improved symptoms of idiopathic hypersomnia and improved participants’ quality of life, day-to-day functioning, and ability to work. The results also show that side effects decreased with continued treatment.</citation_analysis></p>

        <title>Procedures</title>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Participants who were taking a stable dose of SXB at study entry entered OLT and switched from SXB to the same dosing regimen of LXB. Participants who were not taking SXB at study entry entered OLT and initiated LXB treatment on a once-nightly or twice-nightly dosing regimen, at the discretion of the investigator. The regimen (ie, once nightly, twice nightly) and dose amount could be changed during the OLT to optimize efficacy and tolerability. The protocol included guidance to investigators that participants should be considered for once-nightly dosing if they reported difficulty awakening at night to take the second dose, and that participants should be considered for twice-nightly dosing if they reported disrupted nighttime sleep or difficulty with sleep maintenance. Additionally, investigators could change the regimen to thrice-nightly dosing after initiation at once- or twice-nightly dosing. Maximum starting doses were 3 g/night for participants taking LXB once nightly and 4.5 g/night for participants taking LXB twice nightly. Doses could be titrated in increments of 1.5 g/night per week, up to a maximum nightly dose of 6 g for once-nightly dosing, or 9 g for twice-nightly or thrice-nightly dosing. Individual doses up to 6 g were also allowed as part of a twice- or thrice-nightly regimen as long as the maximum nightly total dose was 9 g/night. For twice- and thrice-nightly regimens, doses were divided equally or unequally, with the first dose administered at bedtime and the second and third (when applicable) doses administered at 2.5- to 4-hour intervals from each other.</citation_analysis></p>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">During SDP, participants remained on their individually optimized stable LXB dose for 2 weeks. Participants who met randomization criteria were then randomized 1:1 to take LXB (at the same dose and regimen as in SDP) or placebo (at a volume and regimen equivalent to the stable LXB dose) as double-blind treatment for 2 weeks during DBRWP. Upon completing DBRWP, participants entered the 24-week OLE period.</citation_analysis></p>

        <title>Statistical Analyses</title>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population included all participants who were randomized to LXB or placebo, took at least 1 dose of study medication during DBRWP, and had at least 1 set of post-randomization assessments for ESS or IHSS, or PGIc at the end of DBRWP. The safety population included all participants who took at least 1 dose of study medication. Descriptive analyses were conducted post hoc for efficacy endpoints from baseline through end of SDP in the mITT population (and safety population, for individual IHSS item scores). Selected efficacy endpoints were subsequently analyzed post hoc in participant subgroups defined by treatment at study entry, idiopathic hypersomnia phenotype (with and without LST), and LXB dosing regimen (maintained on once nightly, maintained on twice nightly, or switched between once and twice nightly). Differences in ESS and IHSS scores were assessed between dosing regimens at each timepoint using a linear mixed model with ESS or IHSS as response variables, with baseline ESS or IHSS, dose regimen group, and interaction between visit and dose regimen as fixed effects, and visit as a random effect; participants who were on twice-nightly dosing or switched between regimens were compared against those who remained on once-nightly dosing. The number of LXB dose adjustments required to reach a stable dose and time to stable dose (days) during OLT were examined in the population who completed the SDP and entered DBRWP, and in subgroups stratified by baseline medication (SXB with or without alerting agents, alerting agents only, and treatment naive). The overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and TEAEs in ≥5% of participants were examined in 4-week periods during the OLT and SDP (ie, weeks 1–4, 5–8, 9–12, and 13–16).

An additional 23 (14.9%) participants discontinued after completing the SDP; 3 participants discontinued after SDP but before DBRWP.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Double-blind results are important for describing the effects of treatment compared with placebo. However, because this study had a randomized withdrawal design, important treatment effects were seen in the open-label dose titration and treatment optimization period, which is the focus of this separate paper. The current open-label results show strong improvement not only in ESS, IHSS, and PGIc, but also in HRQoL endpoints (ie, the FOSQ-10 and WPAI:SHP). Furthermore, the novel data included on baseline values and treatment effects for individual IHSS items aid understanding about the symptoms and functional impact of idiopathic hypersomnia, as well as the impact of treatment. In the OLT and SDP sections of this double-blind randomized withdrawal study of LXB in adults with idiopathic hypersomnia, improvements were seen within the first 4 weeks across the ESS, IHSS, PGIc, and CGIc endpoints, and these improvements were maintained through the SDP. At week 1, the mean ESS and IHSS scores decreased from baseline by 2.3 and 4.4 points, respectively, which is consistent with the established thresholds for a minimum within-person change (≥2 points for ESS [based on narcolepsy] and 4 points for IHSS [IH specific]).</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Improvements in scores of the QoL measures FOSQ-10 and WPAI:SHP were also observed at the end of stable-dose treatment. Participants reached a stable dose of LXB in a median of 48.5 days; the median dose was 7 g/night, and the majority of participants were stable on a twice-nightly dosing regimen. Subgroup analyses confirmed that the beneficial effects of LXB treatment were independent of dosing regimen or the presence of long sleep time. The incidence of TEAEs with LXB treatment decreased over the duration of the study.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="negative">The median time to reach a stable dose of LXB and number of dose adjustments required were generally similar in participants who were treatment naive and participants who entered the study taking alerting agents only for idiopathic hypersomnia. Participants who entered the study taking SXB reached a stable dose quickly and with few dose adjustments; 4 out of 6 of them required no dose adjustments. Investigators could initiate participants on a once- or twice-nightly regimen at their discretion and were free to change the regimen throughout the titration period. Majorities, however, stayed on their initial regimen (74.0%) during OLT, and were stable on twice-nightly dosing (75.6%), with a minority stable on once-nightly dosing (23.6%); thus, extensive switching among LXB regimens in the present study was uncommon and therefore unlikely to have led to longer titration times. A spectrum of optimized doses was seen during SDP, suggesting that individualized titration was important for clinicians and their patients. The efficacy seen in participants taking once-nightly LXB is noteworthy, as participants were able to receive the benefits of LXB therapy with a dosing regimen that was optimized based on their clinical response. The median time of 48.5 days required to reach a stable dose of LXB among participants with idiopathic hypersomnia was longer than the median of 29 days seen in all participants in the clinical study of LXB for participants with narcolepsy.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> This could be because clinicians took a cautious approach when titrating LXB in participants with idiopathic hypersomnia. Even physicians who may have experience using SXB or LXB in patients with narcolepsy likely had less familiarity with treatments for idiopathic hypersomnia, as there were no FDA-approved therapies for idiopathic hypersomnia at the time of the study.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Finally, it has been demonstrated previously that while many participants with narcolepsy showed a clinically meaningful response to SXB within 2 months, on average, a period of over 3 months is required to reach the maximum therapeutic response to SXB in terms of EDS.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></citation_analysis></p>

Mean ESS scores were within the normal range at the end of SDP, when participants were taking an optimized dose of LXB. The large magnitude of decrease in ESS scores with LXB treatment in this idiopathic hypersomnia population was notable, and compared favorably with the wake-promoting agent modafinil. Of 2 prior randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of modafinil for idiopathic hypersomnia, 1 reported a median reduction in ESS scores of 6.0, while the other reported a least squares mean reduction in Japanese ESS scores of 7.1;</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> the median and mean reductions in ESS score at the end of SDP in the present study were 10.0 and 9.7, respectively.</citation_analysis></p>

At the end of SDP, scores on these 3 items reflected a strong improvement.

In the present study, psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and insomnia, were the most prominent type of TEAE leading to discontinuation. Nausea, headache, and dizziness were the most common TEAEs in the first 4 weeks.

Also, the design of this study included individually optimized LXB dosing, which may more closely reflect real-world practice than forced titration or fixed dosing. Limitations of this study to be acknowledged are, first, that the requirement for participants entering the study taking SXB to have shown documented clinical improvement of EDS with SXB treatment may have introduced selection bias; however, only 6 participants were taking SXB at study entry, so such a bias would have minimal impact. Second, due to the open-label nature of the titration and stable-dosing periods, both participants and clinicians were aware that participants were receiving an active study drug, which could have biased their responses on subjective measures of symptoms severity, QoL, and tolerability during the OLT and SDP.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> LST was determined by the investigator, and this study did not include polysomnography or objective measures of LST.

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">In conclusion, in this study of adults with idiopathic hypersomnia, open-label administration of LXB led to clinically meaningful improvements in idiopathic hypersomnia symptoms and QoL measures, observed from as early as week 1. These changes were maintained or continued to improve through the duration of the titration and optimization period and during the 2 weeks of stable dosing. The mean ESS scores were within the normal range at the end of stable dosing, when participants were taking an optimized dose of LXB. Nearly 25% of patients only required once-nightly dosing. Participants who entered on SXB maintained efficacy after switching to LXB. The safety profile of LXB in the population of adults with idiopathic hypersomnia was similar to its profile in the narcolepsy study population, as well as to the profile of SXB. TEAE incidence declined over time as participants titrated to their stable dose.</citation_analysis></p>
