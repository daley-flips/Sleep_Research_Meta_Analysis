        <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Insomnia is a common sleep complaint in the elderly. The safety and efficacy of eszopiclone, a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic, in elderly patients with chronic insomnia has been established in two 2-week and one 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Eszopiclone 1 mg was effective in reducing sleep latency. Eszopiclone 2 mg was effective in reducing latency to sleep and for increasing sleep maintenance. Eszopiclone doses of 1 mg and 2 mg reduced the number of daytime naps and decreased the duration of naps in elderly patients. Eszopiclone 2 mg improved the quality of life measures for mood, physical health, household activities, medication, leisure activities, and self-report of physical functioning and vitality in the 2-week trials, and vitality and general health in the 12-week trial. The most commonly reported side effects in the elderly included unpleasant taste, dry mouth, dizziness, and somnolence. The concurrent use of drugs that inhibit or induce the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4 can alter concentrations of eszopiclone and the dose may need to be adjusted. The recommended starting dose of eszopiclone for difficulty falling asleep is 1 mg at bedtime. For elders who complain of difficulty maintaining sleep, eszopiclone should be initiated at 2 mg at bedtime. Overall, eszopiclone is a safe and well-tolerated treatment option for elderly patients with insomnia.</citation_analysis></p>

The use of hypnotics in the elderly population is limited secondary to increased sensitivity to adverse drug effects and an overall paucity of trials to support the safety and efficacy of hypnotic agents.

Subjects with stable Axis I diagnoses were included in the study and concurrent use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors was allowed if the patient had been maintained on a steady dose for the past 2 months. Excluded from the trial were subjects with another sleep disorder, or the presence of a medical or psychiatric condition or ingestion of substances that could interfere with sleep. Data were collected each morning and evening from electronic sleep/wake diaries maintained by the subjects (ie, sleep latency, TST, WASO, number of awakenings, quality of sleep, and depth of sleep). Subject-reported change from baseline in TST was the primary efficacy endpoint of this study. Secondary endpoints were the change from baseline in subject-reported SL and WASO averaged over the 12 weeks. The ISI was used to assess the severity and impact of insomnia symptoms.

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Many agents are available to treat insomnia in the geriatric population. Eszopiclone is a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic agent effective for the management of chronic insomnia in elderly patients as demonstrated in three controlled trials. Eszopiclone doses of 2 mg were needed to increase sleep maintenance. Both eszopiclone 1 mg and 2 mg reduced latency to sleep and the number of daytime naps and decreased nap duration. Eszopiclone improved several domains of quality of life and physical well-being in elderly patients in both 2-week and 12-week trials. Eszopiclone was well-tolerated for up to 12 weeks of continuous use by elderly patients. Tolerance to the hypnotic effect of eszopiclone 2 mg for 12 weeks did not develop. Rebound insomnia was not evident after discontinuation of eszopiclone.</citation_analysis></p>
