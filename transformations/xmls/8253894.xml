          <title>Purpose</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">There is great interest in unobtrusive long-term sleep measurements using wearable devices based on reflective photoplethysmography (PPG). Unfortunately, consumer devices are not validated in patient populations and therefore not suitable for clinical use. Several sleep staging algorithms have been developed and validated based on ECG-signals. However, translation from these techniques to data derived by wearable PPG is not trivial, and requires the differences between sensing modalities to be integrated in the algorithm, or having the model trained directly with data obtained with the target sensor. Either way, validation of PPG-based sleep staging algorithms requires a large dataset containing both gold standard measurements and PPG-sensor in the applicable clinical population. Here, we take these important steps towards unobtrusive, long-term sleep monitoring.</citation_analysis></p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Sleep of adequate duration and quality is a central aspect of a healthy life. Many factors can contribute to insufficient or disturbed sleep, including a wide variety of sleep disorders. Objective assessment of sleep structure is an important part of the diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected sleep disorders. The current gold standard is polysomnography (PSG), using an array of body-worn sensors to assess sleep, typically during a single night. Methods to perform long-term ambulatory monitoring of sleep would have important applications, such as more precise severity assessment, evaluation of night-to-night variability and follow-up of treatment. Moreover, the use of unobtrusive methods would provide additional practical benefits as it avoids interference with the sleep of the subjects and may be better accepted, especially in children.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Today, the consumer market is flooded with wearable devices promoting endless possibilities to trace a person’s health by monitoring daily activities, energy expenditure and sleep. Typical consumer sleep trackers contain sensors measuring motion and cardiac activity. Advanced algorithms are then applied to perform sleep staging with the promise to distinguish wake, “light sleep”, “deep sleep”, and Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Importantly, most manufacturers clearly state that their products are not intended for scientific or medical purposes and that care must be exercised when using and interpreting these data.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Nevertheless, a growing number of people collect data from wearables and ask their physician to evaluate their self-measured sleep.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> On the other hand, the clinical use of wearable devices is gaining attention, given the potential advantages including unobtrusive sleep measurements collected in a patient’s natural environment.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> However, proper validation against gold standard PSG is scarcely available as of yet.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Moreover, the limited validation efforts for popular devices are typically restricted to healthy participants, especially young adults with adequate sleep schedules and without sleep disorders.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The combination of modern hardware capabilities and advanced machine learning methods for data analysis yields the promise of technology that can significantly improve the current diagnostic approach in sleep medicine. For example, the use of artificial intelligence to automatically score sleep stages based on PSG results in comparable and – in some cases – more consistent agreement than humans performing the same task.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Automatic scoring of sleep stages based on signals that can be obtained from wearable devices still falls short in comparison to PSG based methods, although performance seems to be catching up.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="negative"> Most well-validated algorithms for what could be called “surrogate sleep staging” use heart rate variability (HRV) as an indicator of autonomic changes during sleep, which have been studied extensively over the last decades. Both the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), which are involved in the cardiac autonomic nervous system, are coupled with circadian rhythm, the sleep-wake cycle, and ultradian processes such as NREM and REM sleep.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> For example, in healthy subjects, autonomic cardiovascular regulation varies considerably per sleep stage. As NREM sleep progresses from light towards deeper sleep, there is an increase in cardiovagal drive and PNS activity and a reduction in cardiac and SNS activity. This results in a decrease in heart rate and increase in the respiratory mediation of HRV and becomes visible in the high-frequency band (HF) (0.15 to 0.4 Hz) of HRV. In contrast, autonomic activity is unstable during REM where PNS and SNS activity fluctuates producing abrupt changes in heart rate. The average heart rate and the power in the low-frequency band (LF) (0.04 to 0.15 Hz) of HRV is higher during REM than during NREM sleep, and there is a shift of the LF/HF ratio towards sympathetic dominance.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> These changes in autonomic activity are often captured with different HRV features, which in turn can be derived from inter-beat intervals (IBIs) obtained by electrocardiography (ECG), while the vast majority of (consumer) sleep trackers use reflective photoplethysmography (PPG) to measure cardiac activity and, in addition, accelerometers to detect body movements. This leaves a gap between the available ECG-based algorithms and the practical application of such algorithms in the context of wearables.

Either approach requires a sufficient amount of data containing both gold standard PSG and PPG measurements from a clinical population. Here, we take this important step towards unobtrusive, long-term remote monitoring of sleep in the clinical setting. We developed an automatic sleep staging model using wrist-worn PPG signals and accelerometry, and trained and validated it on a unique, large dataset containing data from a clinical population comprising children, adolescents and adults with a variety of sleep disorders.</citation_analysis></p>

Even for four-class sleep staging, the algorithm achieved substantial agreement with gold standard PSG. This agreement is in the same κ class as human interscorer agreement for five-class sleep staging.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Predominant confusions of our wearable method pertained between N1+N2 versus wake, N3 and REM. The discrepancy between N3 and N2 was also highest when comparing two human expert scorers in another study.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Importantly, the effect of age on sleep staging performance was limited, indicating that the algorithm is robust across all age categories.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="negative">We investigated the clinical utility of our method by comparing sleep measures estimated by the algorithm with those derived from PSG. Only a small average bias was found for each sleep statistic, albeit with variations between subjects. Our wearable method can thus provide clinically relevant information about a patient’s sleep pattern, especially when visualized as a hypnogram. A difference in performance was found between men and women, but not of an extent that would imply consequences for clinical use. Importantly, performance and estimation of sleep statistics were even better for children and adolescents, despite the limited number of children/adolescents in the training dataset. The reason for this is not fully clear and several factors may contribute. For example, one could speculate that children have less sleep stage transitions. Our algorithm shows sometimes difficulties with the detection of high sleep fragmentation resulting in a better performance on patients with lower fragmentation. In addition, autonomic expression, and in particular parasympathetic activity, is stronger in children, as it is known that parasympathetic tone decreases with increasing age. We could assume that the performance of the algorithm is better in younger subjects with higher PNS activity, since it becomes easier to link high parasympathetic tone with sleep stage N3, regardless of how it was trained. Finally, the performance of our algorithm was lowest for patients with REM parasomnias and this sleep disorder was not present in the children/adolescents group, which could have contributed to the higher performance in this group.</citation_analysis></p>

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Importantly, our algorithm shows relatively high agreement for 2-class Wake/Sleep detection, which is a great advantage over actigraphy.

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Our algorithm had most difficulties with classifying sleep stage N1+N2 and N3 relative to all sleep stages. This phenomenon is quite similar to (dis)agreement between human scoring in the assessment of slow waves using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> When using a classification model based on HRV, this problem is slightly different, but still comparable. It is difficult to establish from which point onward the parasympathetic tone, used as an autonomic hallmark for sleep stage N3, is strong enough to change the classification from sleep stage N2 to N3. These “continuous” changes in the autonomic spectrum remain an obvious limitation of the technology, at least when attempting to provide a surrogate to classical epoch-by-epoch PSG sleep staging.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Another important finding is that the algorithm sometimes shows difficulties with the detection of sleep fragmentation, despite the overall accurate representation of standard sleep architecture parameters. Short non-REM intrusions in REM sleep periods, for instance, are only occasionally detected by the algorithm (see illustrative fragmented REM sleep periods in </citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">). Note that, according to the AASM scoring rules, a mixture of rapid eye-movements and spindles and/or K complexes should be scored as either stage REM or stage N2 depending on the actual occurrence of these events in the respective 30-second epochs.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> However, the algorithm identifies these sleep stages as REM sleep.

The algorithm seems to be less sensitive to these borderline cases.</citation_analysis></p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">In summary, this study shows the ability of automatic sleep staging using PPG and accelerometer measurements obtained with a wrist-worn device, in children, adolescents and adults with a wide variety of sleep disorders. The results demonstrate the maturity of this technique and the opportunities for remote, clinical, long-term sleep monitoring. This may yield a significant change in the clinical approach to diagnosis and follow up of sleep disorders. In addition, it will allow a fundamentally new view on night-to-night variability of sleep as a basis for new pathophysiological insights.</citation_analysis></p>
