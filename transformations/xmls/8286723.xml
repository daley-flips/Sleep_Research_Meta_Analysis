      <title>Plain Language Summary</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Sleep loss can impair performance. However, not all individuals demonstrate performance impairment when sleep deprived. The negative effects of short sleep on performance may be less severe if individuals feel alert and motivated, or if they apply more effort to compensate. We examined whether a person’s reported alertness, motivation, or effort modified the effects of sleep loss on performance.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">We found that individuals who reported lower motivation during five days of short sleep (sleep restriction) responded prematurely more often on a performance task versus when they had full sleep, demonstrating problems with inhibition. However, individuals who reported the same motivation when they were sleep restricted as when well-rested showed no change in inhibition. Both those who reported reduced and preserved motivation demonstrated more instances of slower speed during sleep restriction, and the slowest speeds were observed in those with reduced motivation. Furthermore, individuals who reported applying more effort when they were sleep restricted responded more slowly during sleep restriction, whereas those who reported no change in effort demonstrated maintained speed. Crucially, no matter how alert someone reported feeling, sleep restriction impaired performance.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">These findings suggest that individuals are more likely to demonstrate poor inhibition if they feel less motivated when sleep restricted. Additionally, individuals who report no change in alertness or who report applying greater effort during sleep restriction still demonstrate problems with attention. It is important to understand these effects because poor inhibition may lead to impulsive decisions, and problems with attention may worsen performance in day-to-day life.</citation_analysis></p>

During the structured in-person mental health interview, the clinical psychologist assessed whether the participant was psychologically fit for the study by both reviewing the completed questionnaires and asking questions regarding the participant’s psychological and social wellbeing, history of violence, mood, substance use, problems with concentration, or psychotic symptoms. The psychologist asked probing questions about how the participant would handle the potential stress they may experience in the study, including the lack of sleep, the loss of autonomy, the lack of in-person contact with friends and family, the frequent cognitive testing, and the potential boredom experienced in the lab.

The sleep schedule during the monitoring period was imposed to allow the participants to become accustomed to the in-lab sleep schedule during the baseline nights of the in-lab stay, where time in bed was also from 22:00 to 08:00. The ± 1 hour cushion was added to accommodate differences in habitual sleep timing.

First, the mean level across all administrations on the last baseline day (succeeding the third baseline night; first two days excluded) was computed (one baseline mean value for each measure) per participant. Mean levels were computed per day of sleep restriction (five daily means total for each of the three measures) and the mean of those five values was the sleep restriction mean per participant.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The current study examined whether changes in subjective alertness, motivation, and effort across five nights of sleep restriction and two recovery nights moderated performance on the PVT. During sleep restriction, subjective alertness and motivation decreased, while subjective effort increased; all three measures rebounded to baseline levels after one recovery night. Furthermore, participants with a greater reduction in subjective motivation made more false starts (a marker of impaired inhibition) and lapses (a marker of degraded vigilant attention) during sleep restriction, while participants with relatively preserved subjective motivation demonstrated no change in false starts and a less pronounced increase in lapses. Those reporting more effort during sleep restriction demonstrated more lapses across sleep restriction, whereas participants with preserved subjective effort did not demonstrate a change in lapses with sleep restriction. PVT performance during sleep restriction was not moderated by change in subjective alertness. These results suggest that individuals with less of a decrease in subjective motivation after sleep restriction may be resistant to the negative effects of sleep restriction on inhibitory control and less susceptible to lapses of attention. However, individuals exerting greater subjective effort or with preserved subjective alertness during sleep restriction may still be susceptible to vigilance decrements.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The findings that individuals with a greater decrease in subjective motivation made more false starts during sleep restriction, but that lapses rose both in those with lower subjective motivation and (to a lesser extent) in those with preserved subjective motivation, suggest differences between the underlying propensity to commit more errors of omission (lapses) versus errors of commission (false starts) during sleep loss. As sleep loss generally increases impulsive behavior</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> (though other research suggests no impact; see</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive">), those with lower levels of subjective motivation during sleep restriction may be more likely to behave impulsively and commit more false starts. These individuals could therefore have difficulty overcoming the desire to tap the screen prematurely during a low-arousal, monotonous task. Subjective motivation tends to decline after sleep loss, particularly for tasks of sustained attention.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Our results suggest interindividual differences in changes in subjective motivation that may explain differences among individuals in the susceptibility to commit false starts during sleep restriction. Our findings align with previous research demonstrating that monetary incentives failed to shorten RT on a sustained attention task but succeeded at improving accuracy.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="negative"> Similarly, greater subjective motivation on an anti-saccade task was associated with fewer errors but not a difference in RT.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Present findings regarding false starts recorded on a touchscreen device may not translate to PVTs requiring a keypress response, as lapses and false starts are highly correlated on a keypress but not a touchscreen PVT, and false starts across the two platforms are only moderately correlated.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref></citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">In contrast to false starts, lapses and slower response speed during sleep loss reflect reduced objective behavioral alertness, possibly due to “state instability,” or variability in attention capacity resulting in part from rising homeostatic sleep pressure.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Individuals with preserved subjective motivation, then, may demonstrate a less pronounced decrease in vigilance after sleep restriction compared to those with a greater decrease in subjective motivation. However, those with preserved subjective motivation still demonstrated more lapses of attention during sleep restriction compared to baseline, though they demonstrated no change in false starts. A more parsimonious explanation for the lack of change in false starts during sleep restriction in those with preserved subjective motivation is that participants were alerted whenever they registered responses before the millisecond counter appeared (though not for responses between 0 and 100 ms, also categorized as false starts). In contrast, participants were not explicitly alerted when lapses occurred even though they were continuously informed of their RT. It is possible that participants with increased subjective motivation used the feedback about premature responses to prevent making more false starts. Additionally, participants were presented after the task with a score comparing their performance to previous administrations, which could be intrinsically motivating. In one study, participants had shorter RT and reported greater motivation during an RT task incorporating feedback (displaying mean, shortest, and longest RTs after each trial block) compared to one with no feedback.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="negative"> Future research may determine whether incorporating feedback about long RTs can affect subsequent lapses after sleep loss in participants with preserved subjective motivation.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Individuals who are more resistant to the effects of sleep loss may naturally perform better and therefore need to apply less effort to perform well, whereas individuals more susceptible to the effects of sleep loss may apply more effort to compensate but are unable to overcome the impairment. In the current study, individuals reporting a greater increase in effort, versus others with relatively preserved subjective effort, made more lapses during sleep restriction that persisted into the first recovery day, potentially reflecting a reduced capacity to perform optimally under conditions of sleep loss. Some individuals may have to apply greater effort to remain awake and perform optimally as homeostatic sleep pressure increases, and certain individuals may have more accumulation of sleep pressure during sleep restriction due to greater sleep need. Such reduced capacity to perform may have physiological underpinnings, such as the accumulation of homeostatic sleep pressure during excess wake.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Individuals who reported greater elevations in effort in the current study may have had incomplete dissipation of sleep pressure (defined as the dissipation of slow-wave activity during early sleep) during the first night of recovery sleep, resulting in a sustained elevation of lapses the next day. Notably, sleep pressure demonstrates trait-like differences among individuals.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Participants experiencing greater sensitivity to the effects of rising homeostatic sleep pressure</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> on performance may have correspondingly increased their effort to compensate for these performance limitations, but were unsuccessful as evidenced by elevated lapses. Previous research demonstrated a high correlation between false starts and lapses across 88 hours of total sleep deprivation, with the authors hypothesizing that participants attempted to compensate for lapses by increasing responses (a measure of objective effort) and, consequently, committing more false starts.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Based on these previous findings, it would be expected that individuals reporting greater effort in the current study would commit more false starts during sleep restriction versus those with preserved effort; however, false starts increased regardless of changes in subjective effort. Accordingly, objective and subjective measures of effort during sleep restriction may be separate constructs. Future research may compare objective and subjective measures of effort during several days of sleep restriction and their associations with performance.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Our findings demonstrate that interindividual differences in the changes in subjective motivation and effort moderate the impact of sleep restriction on attentional performance. We cannot, however, conclude from the current study that reduced subjective motivation or elevated effort caused the poorer performance in these individuals. The present study did not manipulate subjective motivation or effort; thus, causation cannot be established. Rather, our results suggest potential trait-like differences among individuals in changes in subjective motivation and effort during sleep restriction that may distinguish vulnerability to poorer attentional performance between persons. Given the correlation between greater subjective motivation and better performance,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37–39</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> it is plausible that more preserved subjective motivation prevented performance decrements in certain individuals. However, it is unlikely that increasing effort caused the increase in lapses exhibited by individuals who reported greater elevations in effort during sleep restriction.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Our findings corroborate the notion that subjective alertness is not a suitable marker for objective performance deficits during sleep restriction. Regardless of changes in subjective alertness during sleep loss, false starts and lapses increased and response speed decreased during sleep restriction, in line with previous research.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9–15</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Therefore, participants who reported more preserved alertness were just as likely to make false starts and lapses and exhibit slower response speed as their less-alert counterparts. While lapses increase linearly across sleep restriction,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="negative"> subjective alertness either does not decrease across days of sleep restriction</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> or decreases at a slower rate than the increase in lapses,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> indicating a mismatch between subjective and objective measures of alertness during sleep loss. Research regarding the relationship between subjective alertness and false starts during sleep restriction is more limited, but our study suggests that, similar to impaired vigilance, preserved subjective alertness may be insufficient to maintain inhibitory control during sleep loss. The misalignment between subjective alertness and objective performance may be implicated in some instances of motor vehicle crashes induced by drowsy driving.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="negative"> Certain individuals, when sleep-deprived, may feel subjectively alert and could overestimate their ability to perform well in their sleep-deprived state.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="negative">The present results suggest that changes in subjective motivation and effort during sleep restriction can distinguish interindividual differences in dichotomous lapses of attention (≥500 ms) but not the continuous metric of response speed. Lapses may be due to a loss of task-oriented attention that occurs, in part, due to less subjective alertness and more fatigue.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Though changes in subjective motivation and effort moderated the effects of sleep restriction on lapses, we did not find any interaction for response speed, perhaps because lapses of attention are fundamentally distinct from RTs that fall within the “normal” range (typically defined as 100–500 ms).</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref></citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The current study had some limitations. The sample size was somewhat small, and future studies would benefit from a larger number of participants. Only young males were recruited, limiting the generalizability of the present study. Future studies should examine whether these findings are applicable to females and/or older adults. All participants experienced the same study protocol in order: baseline, sleep restriction, and recovery, resulting in the potential for order effects on cognitive performance. However, a substantial practice effect for the task used in the current study is unlikely. The PVT requires fewer than 5 administrations before maximal performance on lapses and response speed is reached,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> and we excluded the admission day and the first two days of baseline from statistical analyses due to the improvement in false starts observed during baseline.
