          <title>Purpose</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Real-world data regarding divided nightly dosing of oxybate and individualized prescribing in patients with narcolepsy are limited. Study objectives were to understand oxybate prescribing practices, including optimizing dose regimens and adjusting dosing per occasional changes in patients’ routines, and physician recommendations for representative patient scenarios.</citation_analysis></p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Patients and Methods</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">A cross-sectional, web- and audio-based survey of physicians treating ≥2 patients with narcolepsy, prescribed nightly oxybate (sodium oxybate) dosing for ≥6 months, was conducted. Physicians were surveyed on patients’ usual oxybate dosing regimens, frequency of and reasons for oxybate dosing-related discussions, and preferred methods for and perceptions of adjusting oxybate dosing. Physicians provided dosing-related guidance for 4 representative scenarios.</citation_analysis></p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Participating physicians (N=25) were neurologists (52%), psychiatrists (44%), and neuropsychiatrists (4%). Individualized oxybate prescribing practices were reflected by the variability of physicians’ reporting of the percentage of their patients being prescribed once-nightly, twice-nightly, and thrice-nightly dosing regimens. Most physicians (68%) reported discussing adjusting individualized treatment to accommodate occasional changes to patients’ routines; the most common reasons were consuming contraindicated beverages (alcohol; 65%) and travel (59%). Adjusting total nightly dose (68%) and dose timing (68%) were preferred adjustment methods. Most physicians (88%) felt the ability to individualize oxybate dosing was important and had a positive impact on ability to provide care. For each representative scenario, physicians provided several dose-adjustment recommendations, and physician responses encouraged patient participation in treatment decision-making.</citation_analysis></p>

          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Physicians provided guidance supportive of oxybate dose adjustments to accommodate occasional changes in patients’ routines, and perceived individualized dosing as important in providing care.</citation_analysis></p>

        <sec id="S2001">
          <title>Why was the research needed?</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Narcolepsy is an uncommon condition that causes individuals to feel sleepy throughout the day. Other symptoms may include sudden muscle weakness. There is no cure for narcolepsy, but there are several treatments, including medicines known as oxybates. This study focused on how doctors use oxybate to treat patients with narcolepsy.</citation_analysis></p>

        <sec id="S2002">
          <title>How was the research done?</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">This study was an online survey of doctors who were treating 2 or more patients with narcolepsy. Patients had been taking oxybate for at least 6 months. The survey asked doctors about their patients’ normal oxybate usage, how often and why they discussed oxybate treatment, and which ways oxybate treatment was usually adjusted.</citation_analysis></p>

        <sec id="S2003">
          <title>What are the results?</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Twenty-five doctors took part in this study. Most doctors said they discuss personalized treatment to help with occasional changes in their patients’ daily lives. The most common reasons for making treatment changes were consuming alcohol and travel. The most common changes were total nightly amount and timing of oxybate. Most doctors said the ability to personalize oxybate treatment is important and has a positive impact.</citation_analysis></p>

Just under half (48%) of physicians recommended changing the number of doses (ie, taking a single dose rather than 2, or 2 doses rather than 3), for reasons including encouraging adherence, improving wakefulness the next day, work responsibilities, family obligations, a late bedtime, and alcohol consumption.

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">This is the first study of its kind (to our knowledge) to elicit physician feedback regarding clinical practice (real-world) oxybate prescribing patterns for patients with narcolepsy as well as the circumstances surrounding, and perceptions regarding, oxybate dosing individualization to accommodate the patients’ lifestyles. The results showed that 64% of physicians reported that a majority of their patients were on equally divided dosing as recommended in the SXB prescribing information,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> although some were prescribed unequal dosing.

Adjustments were noted as occurring daily (7.2%), a few days per week (6.4%), or a few days per month or less (13.3%). Similarly, patients deviated from the recommended timing of taking oxybate relative to meals (2–3 hours after eating); 19.3% reported taking oxybate within 2 hours of food consumption, and reported that deviations occurred daily (4.3%), a few days per week (6.1%), or a few days per month or less (8.7%).

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Physicians in this study described their dosing-individualization interactions with patients as common and mostly patient initiated. The results indicate that physicians deal with these dosing-adjustment situations with some frequency, and that the requests for adjustment guidance are patient driven, situation dependent, and separate from the patient education/instruction on oxybate treatment that they proactively provide to the patient. Many physicians adjusted their patients’ oxybate dosing regimen to accommodate occasional changes to usual routines. The majority of physicians recommended adjusting the total nightly dose and/or the timing of the doses when providing personalized oxybate dosing guidance. The circumstances of the needed adjustments varied and included traveling, attending work/work events, caring for family members, accommodating mealtimes, romance with a bed partner, and dealing with unexpected situations. When providing recommendations to the representative patient vignettes, physicians often responded in role, provided multiple options for adjustments, and adopted a collaborative approach to individualizing oxybate regimens to meet the needs of their patients. This collaborative approach is indicative of physicians’ commitment to addressing these patient needs, which is facilitated by the flexibility afforded by SXB and LXB dosing to personalize treatment for their patients.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Physicians in this study perceived the ability to adjust oxybate dosing regimens to accommodate occasional changes in patients’ routines as important/very important and indicated that this ability has a positive impact on their capacity to provide care to their patients; no physicians had a negative impression regarding the ability to adjust dosing regimens. This has implications for positively impacting quality of care. Studies assessing the impact of individualized interventions tailored to address specific situations or treatment decisions on patient adherence, outcomes, and/or satisfaction with treatment have previously reported a benefit of individualized treatment on patient outcomes.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24–26</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> The current results provide evidence that physicians in clinical practice are individualizing therapy by taking into consideration patients’ psychosocial circumstances and other lifestyle situations when making treatment recommendations. This in turn may facilitate patients’ adherence to their oxybate treatment and improve patient outcomes and satisfaction.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">An important consideration in providing individualized dosing adjustment guidance to accommodate various patient situations is the confidence and comfort level of the treating physician who is providing this guidance. In this study, the sample included sleep physicians who were largely experienced clinicians (ie, an average of 16 years in practice) and had considerable experience treating patients with oxybate (an average of 25 patients who were prescribed oxybate). This may partially account for the high percentage of physicians who discussed dosing adjustments with patients and the types of adjustments they have recommended. The multiple options they recommended for the representative patient scenarios suggested that the physicians were fairly well versed in providing recommendations to patients on ways to adjust their oxybate dosing regimens to address different types of life situations. Sleep physicians who are new to treating patients with narcolepsy using LXB may benefit from the guidance of experienced oxybate prescribers. Due to its composition of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybates, LXB contains 92% less sodium content than high-sodium oxybates (SXB and FD-SXB). In June 2021, the FDA’s Office of Orphan Products Development granted Orphan Drug Exclusivity to LXB, summarizing that LXB is clinically superior to SXB by means of greater safety because LXB provides a greatly reduced sodium burden, and the differences in chronic sodium intake will be clinically meaningful in reducing cardiovascular morbidity in a substantial proportion of patients for whom the drug is indicated.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> The FDA recognizes that FD-SXB</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> contains the same amount of sodium as SXB;</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> therefore, the difference in the sodium content between LXB</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> and FD-SXB is likely to be clinically meaningful in all patients with narcolepsy. Head-to-head trials between LXB and SXB or FD-SXB were not conducted.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Limitations of the study include the cross-sectional design, which precluded collection of data on specific patient circumstances and the context in which dosing adjustment guidance occurred for each situation. The use of representative patient vignettes to collect data on physician recommendations regarding dosing adjustment was appropriate within the context of a cross-sectional study design. While this evaluation yielded important insights into how physicians frame the guidance they provide, it is based on representative rather than actual patient situations, and it is possible that physicians may respond differently to a representative patient vignette compared with a real-life situation. Information regarding the impact of adjustments on narcolepsy symptoms was not collected, as the survey focused on physician prescribing practices and not clinical response or effectiveness. Finally, the study sample of 25 US-based physicians may limit the generalizability of these findings to a larger physician population, particularly in international settings.</citation_analysis></p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">In summary, the results of this cross-sectional study provide a valuable overview of real-world oxybate physician prescribing patterns and the frequency and circumstances for providing dose adjustment guidance. Further investigation is needed to improve the individualized dosing guidance that physicians provide, in their clinical practice, to patients, and more mentorship would be helpful for physicians newly treating patients with oxybate. Additionally, future studies evaluating similar prescribing practices in pediatric patients may be worthwhile.</citation_analysis></p>
