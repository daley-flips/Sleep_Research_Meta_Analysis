          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Sleep apnea (SA) is highly prevalent, but under diagnosed due to inaccessibility of sleep testing. To address this issue, portable devices for home sleep testing have been developed to provide convenience with reasonable accuracy in diagnosing SA.

          <title>Patients and Methods</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Adults with a suspected sleep disorder were recruited to undergo in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG) and a simultaneous BresoDX1 recording. Data from BresoDX1 were collected and features related to breathing sounds, body motions and oximetry were extracted. A deep neural network (DNN) model was trained with 61-second epochs of the extracted features to detect apneas and hypopneas from which an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was calculated. The AHI estimated by BresoDX1 (AHI</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><sub>breso</sub></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">) was compared to the AHI determined from PSG (AHI</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><sub>PSG</sub></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive">) and the sensitivity and specificity of SA diagnosis were assessed at an AHI</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><sub>PSG</sub></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> ≥ 15.</citation_analysis></p>

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Portable devices generally use nasal pressure cannulae for measuring airflow, respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) or piezo-electric crystals for measuring respiratory motion and finger oximetry to measure arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><sub>2</sub></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="negative">) to detect respiratory events. However, during unattended sleep monitoring at home, nasal cannulae, respiratory bands and oximeters can be displaced so that signals may either be inconsistent or lost.

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">To detect apneas and hypopneas, and diagnose SA according to AASM criteria, commercially available portable sleep monitoring devices must assess respiratory airflow or motion plus SaO</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><sub>2</sub></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive">. This requires four or five points of attachment of these instruments to patients in different areas of the body and, therefore, is somewhat complicated and inconvenient. Airflow is generally assessed by nasal pressure cannulae or thermistors, while chest wall motion is generally assessed by stretchy bands that include either RIP or piezo-electric crystals.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24–26</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> However, thermistors are quantitatively insensitive to changes in airflow, while nasal pressure is insensitive to changes in airflow during mouth breathing and can be displaced during sleep. RIP and piezo-electric crystal recordings require wearing stretchy chest and abdominal bands that are inconvenient and can be displaced during sleep, resulting in distortion or loss of signals. In addition, piezo-electric crystals’ responses to chest wall movements are non-linear, making piezo belts insensitive to hypopneas. Therefore, they are only recommended by AASM for monitoring respiratory effort and not for respiratory event scoring.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> In contrast, BresoDX1 only requires two points of attachment: the suprasternal notch and the finger, and is therefore simpler and more convenient to apply than most other home SA monitoring devices. In addition, because the trachea-sternal module is fixed in-place by adhesive tape, it is resistant to displacement during sleep, resulting a very little signal loss. Furthermore, the integration of tracheo-sternal motion and breath sounds provides a highly accurate estimation of changes in airflow</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> that, in combination with oximetry, provides a highly accurate estimate of AHI and detection of SA at various AHI cut-offs compared to PSG. The advantages of BresoDX1 compared to other portable devices are its convenience and the robustness of its composite trachea-sternal motion and tracheal sound recordings to estimate changes in airflow.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> These signals along with SaO</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><sub>2</sub></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> provide sufficient channels to detect respiratory events during sleep and estimate AHI.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">To estimate AHI from the BresoDX1 recordings, the detection algorithm was developed using two DNNs. As DNN1 was trained to detect spontaneous changes in feature time-series, DNN2 took into account the long-term changes and thus was designed to take into account circulation delay between changes in SaO</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><sub>2</sub></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> detected at the finger and tracheal signals. Furthermore, we extracted 124 features over time. This many features can be affected temporally by various dynamics such as respiratory event occurrence, changes in sleep stages and body posture and increases in background noise. Although DNN2 compensated for dynamic changes, and thus, accurately estimated AHI and AHI cut-offs, there is significant potential, for example via enhancing its structure, to enhance the accuracy of AHI quantification and SA detection as well as to detect sleep and wakefulness states and snoring sounds.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Our study has some limitations. First, we did not measure sleep time directly, and used valid recording time as the denominator for the AHI. Therefore, we may have over or under estimated true sleep time. Nevertheless, this approach is similar to almost all home SA detection devices, and we demonstrated BresoDX1’s accuracy in estimating AHI</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><sub>PSG</sub></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> and in detecting SA at different AHI cut-offs, indicating its validity. Second, BresoDX1 was tested during attended PSG in a sleep laboratory, not in unattended setting in subjects’ homes. Accordingly, further testing in the latter environment will be necessary to assess BresoDX1’s ability to detect SA in a more clinically relevant setting.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">In conclusion, BresoDX1 is a portable SA testing device that employs trachea-sternal motion and sound, along with oximetry, to provide accurate estimates of the AHI as well as to detect SA at various AHI cut-offs. It accomplishes this through the use of deep learning to develop novel algorithms to detect respiratory events. The strengths of the device are that it is simple and convenient, since it only requires two points of contact for its sensors. Also, the tracheal module is less subject to displacement and signal loss during sleep than other devices because it is fixed to the skin by adhesive tape. In addition, since this was the first iteration of the DNNs for signal analysis, the algorithms employed should be considered prototypes. Consequently, we believe there is room to improve the accuracy of AHI quantification and SA detection as well as to estimate sleep time via further enhancements to the DNNs. Finally, as the only expendable item is the adhesive strip, it could easily be used for multiple night monitoring where necessary. It is well-known that there is considerable night-to-night variation in the AHI,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> and for this reason, there is increasing acceptance of multiple night testing to increase the accuracy of SA diagnosis.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28–30</xref></citation_analysis></p>
