      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">The current study is a supplementary study paired with a randomized clinical trial (RCT; Clinical Trials NCT02653664) investigating the efficacy of psychologically based non-pharmacological treatments for chronic pain in US Veterans with diverse chronic pain conditions.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Each of the three study treatment conditions in the RCT included 8 in-person group sessions, delivered by allied health professionals on staff at a large Veterans Health Administration (VA) medical system in the Northwest.

Participants were recruited into the parent RCT via clinical provider referrals, mailed invitations based on medical record screenings, and self-referral. The supplementary study was approved for funding in the third year of the parent RCT. Study staff approached all who subsequently enrolled in the parent RCT to participate in the supplementary study. Those who were interested in joining the supplementary study were asked to complete an additional informed consent. Of the 213 individuals approached, 184 (86%) enrolled in the supplementary study, and of these, 174 (95%) were randomized to treatment. The present investigation is based on the N = 174 Veterans who were randomized to treatment.</citation_analysis></p>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Participants were eligible if they had enrolled in the parent RCT after meeting the following criteria: Veteran status (defined as prior service in the US Armed Forces and eligible to receive health care services through the Veterans Health Administration); 18 years of age or older; self-reported presence of chronic physical pain; average pain intensity rating of greater than or equal to 3 on a 0–10 Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) of pain intensity in the last week;</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> worst pain intensity rating of greater than or equal to 5 on the 0–10 NRS of pain intensity in the last week; duration of chronic pain 3 months or more; experiencing pain at least 75% of the time in the past three months; and able to read, speak, and understand English.</citation_analysis></p>

Treatment fidelity was maintained with twice monthly supervision by research investigators and monitored using adherence rating forms tailored for each condition. Average fidelity adherence ratings were 97% across the clinicians and conditions.</citation_analysis></p>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">The hypnosis condition involved training in self-hypnosis to mitigate pain under the premise that people can be trained to enter a state of focused attention that makes them more open to suggestions for making changes in perceptions, sensations, thoughts, and behaviors.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Each hypnosis session included a scripted hypnosis activity comprising an induction, clinical suggestions, posthypnotic suggestions, and a posthypnosis alerting process, followed by discussion focused on encouraging home practice. In-session hypnotic inductions were 15–30 minutes in duration. All of the clinical suggestions included in the hypnotic sessions targeted some combination of increased comfort, increases in adaptive thoughts about or the meaning of pain, or improvements in comorbid symptoms thought to impact pain (eg, improved mood and optimism, relaxation, and sleep quality).

When the analysis was repeated for each treatment condition separately, the cross-lagged reciprocal relationships were again not statistically significant.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">This supplementary study was part of a larger study of US Armed Forces Veterans with chronic pain who were randomized to one of three pain treatments: training in self-hypnosis, training in mindfulness meditation, or education control intervention. In the supplementary study, additional data were collected using self-report instruments measuring subjective sleep disturbance, pain intensity, and pain catastrophizing, as well as actigraphic assessments of objective sleep duration. These sleep and pain measurements were obtained at baseline, after the 8–12-week treatment period, and during 3-month follow-up. At baseline, average pain intensity scores indicated moderate pain severity;</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> pain catastrophizing scores were just below the clinically relevant threshold;</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> and sleep disturbance was greater than the US population average.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> However, actigraphic sleep duration was consistent with the recommended 7–8 hours of daily sleep for adults.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> In all three treatment conditions, pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, and subjective sleep disturbance decreased from baseline to posttreatment, and remained at a decreased (ie, improved) level at 3-month follow-up. However, objective sleep duration did not change significantly over time. Furthermore, subjective sleep and pain measures, but not objective sleep duration, were strongly associated at and between the three time points. Observations at prior assessments predicted observations for the same outcome variables at subsequent assessments. Results from cross-lagged regression analyses indicated that changes in sleep and pain occurred in parallel.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Despite the smaller sample of the supplementary study, findings with regard to pain intensity and subjective sleep disturbance were similar to those reported in the primary RCT.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Here, we added the variables of pain catastrophizing and objective sleep duration. As in the primary RCT, the improvements over time from pre- to posttreatment were not significantly different between the two active treatment conditions (hypnosis and mindfulness meditation) compared to the education control condition. The observed improvements were sustained at the 3-month assessment, and at this time point, significant differences between treatment conditions emerged; hypnosis yielded a greater reduction in pain intensity than the education control condition. These findings align with previously reported benefits of hypnosis on pain intensity,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> pain interference,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> and pain catastrophizing.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> However, the findings of this sleep study differed from the primary RCT in that for the latter, significant improvements were noted in the mindfulness meditation condition relative to the education control condition at 3-month follow-up. The smaller sample of the supplementary study could explain this difference.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Unexpectedly, objective sleep duration was greater in the educational control condition than in the other two conditions. However, this condition difference was already present at baseline, and thus likely reflects idiosyncratic variability among individuals assigned to the different conditions. Objective sleep duration was relatively unchanged over time despite improvements over time in subjective sleep disturbance. This likely reflects a ceiling effect on objective sleep duration – in the absence of significant sleep insufficiency, increases in sleep duration are limited by the circadian drive for wakefulness from the endogenous biological clock.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The divergence between objective and subjective measures of sleep in this study suggests that in our sample of Veterans, reduced sleep quality rather than reduced sleep quantity was the predominant effect of pain on sleep. Prior research suggests that sleep disturbances may present a barrier to treatment engagement and therefore contribute to attrition rates in Veteran studies of web-based cognitive-behavioral therapy.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="negative"> Further research could examine whether subjective poor sleep quality contributed to the inability of this sample of Veterans to maximize the potential benefits of the treatments provided.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Also of note, while this study restricted eligibility to Veterans who had not been hospitalized for PTSD within five years, our previous investigation found more than half of the participants scored above the clinically relevant threshold for PTSD as measured by the PTSD Checklist 5 (PCL-5).</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="negative"> PTSD was also significantly correlated with subjective sleep disturbance.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> The interplay between sleep, pain, and PTSD among Veterans is an area worthy of further attention. Similarly, other mental health conditions that we did not investigate in this study are known to impact sleep and pain and may have influenced study outcomes. Baseline levels of depression and anxiety have been previously reported as higher on average than those of healthy normal US populations for participants in this supplementary sleep study sample.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">The study design provided an opportunity to examine whether changes in sleep preceded changes in pain measures, or vice versa, or whether sleep and pain changed in parallel, among Veterans with chronic pain. The correlations in </citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> imply that the observations for the self-report measures were highly stable within individuals across the three time points. This was seen for actigraphic sleep duration as well, but to a lesser extent. In the cross-lagged regression analyses, a high level of consistency in measurements over time within individuals was also observed. Although pain intensity and subjective sleep disturbance at prior assessments were significantly predictive of pain intensity and subjective sleep disturbance at subsequent assessments, the cross-lagged reciprocal relationships were not statistically significant for any of the treatment conditions. It appears that in the participants of this supplementary study, changes in sleep and pain over time were distinct phenomena occurring in parallel.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">It is possible these findings reflect limitations of the time intervals between measurements and examining group data versus individual outcomes; high between-subjects variability could hamper the ability to detect causal patterns. However, it is also possible that the findings reflect true bidirectionality of the relationship between pain and sleep, as previously suggested by others.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Studies have shown that sleep disturbance increases next-day pain,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12–14</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> and thus it stands to reason that improvements in sleep could result in improvements in pain. Similarly, it is well known that pain interferes with sleep,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> and thus improvements in pain could result in improvements in sleep. Further, the two pain treatments in this study may have independently improved sleep as well. Training in self-hypnosis and mindfulness meditation have each been used effectively to improve sleep,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0054" ref-type="bibr">54–57</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> albeit those therapies focused on sleep disturbances specifically; it is not clear whether the interventions have a more generic influence on next-night sleep regardless of the treatment content. Nonetheless, the hypnosis and mindfulness treatments for chronic pain employed in this study could have produced changes in sleep and pain that were truly simultaneous, either through parallel mechanisms or through a single mechanism with multiple concurrent effects.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Limitations of the study include the loss of actigraphy data exceeding the overall attrition rates of the supplementary study. This data loss reduced the sample size for the actigraphy measurements to below the pre-assessed threshold for adequate statistical power and may have limited our ability to detect associations between sleep and pain in the cross-lagged regression analyses. Additionally, our ability to investigate temporal relationships between sleep and pain was constrained by the time intervals between the baseline, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up assessments. Specifically, it is possible that changes in sleep precede changes in pain, or vice versa, at shorter time scales, and this would have gone unnoticed in our study design.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The ability to detect whether improvements in sleep predict improvements in pain may also have been limited by the fact that the baseline pain intensity was moderate, pain catastrophizing was just below the clinically relevant threshold, sleep disturbance was less than one standard deviation higher than the mean of the general population, and sleep duration was in line with the recommended level for healthy adults. While the observed levels of pain and sleep disturbance are not insignificant, outcomes may have been different if individuals with more clinically significant chronic pain or sleep disturbance had been enrolled. Results may not generalize to populations with more severe degrees of pain or greater levels of pain catastrophizing.</citation_analysis></p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Assessing the role of sleep within the context of novel non-pharmacological pain treatments is necessary to understand therapeutic mechanisms and, potentially, to reveal underlying causal relationships. It remains unclear whether treatment-related reductions in pain are a result of improvements in sleep disturbance, whether sleep disturbance improves as a result of reduced pain, or both. Our findings corroborated previously reported benefits of training in self-hypnosis and mindfulness meditation on both pain and pain-related sleep problems, but did not show that changes in sleep preceded changes in pain or vice versa in the study sample. That is, for the Veterans participating in this study, changes in sleep disturbance and pain appeared to occur in parallel. These parallel changes in sleep disturbance and pain suggest that, just like treatments improving pain may yield benefits for sleep, treatments improving sleep may yield benefits for pain in populations experiencing chronic pain.</citation_analysis></p>
