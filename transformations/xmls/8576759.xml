          <title>Purpose</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Previous research indicates that mothers take a larger responsibility for child care during the night and that they have more disturbed sleep than fathers. The purpose of this study was to determine whether such a sleep imbalance exists in working parents of young children, and the extent to which it depends on the way sleep is measured. The study also examined whether imbalanced sleep between parents predicts parental stress and relationship satisfaction.</citation_analysis></p>

        <sec id="s2002">
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Sleep was measured for seven consecutive days in 60 parenting couples (average age of the youngest child: 3.3 years ± SD 2.5 years). Actigraphs were worn across the week, and ratings of sleep, parental stress, and relationship satisfaction were made daily.</citation_analysis></p>

          <title>Results</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Mothers perceived their sleep quality as worse (</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><italic toggle="yes">b</italic></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">= −0.38 scale units, p&lt;0.001), with more wake periods (</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><italic toggle="yes">b</italic></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">= +0.96 awakenings, p&lt;0.001) but with longer sleep duration (</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><italic toggle="yes">b</italic></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">= +32.4 min, p&lt;0.01) than fathers. Actigraphy data confirmed that mothers slept longer than fathers (</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><italic toggle="yes">b</italic></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive">= +28.03 min, p&lt;0.001), but no significant differences were found for wake time, number of awakenings or who woke up first during shared awakenings. Furthermore, there was no difference in whether mothers and fathers slept sufficiently. The level of sleep imbalance between parents did not predict parental stress. A larger imbalance in subjective sleep sufficiency predicted decreased relationship satisfaction for fathers (b= −0.13 scale units, p&lt;0.01) but increased relationship satisfaction for mothers (b= 0.14 scale units, p&lt;0.05). No other sleep imbalance measures predicted relationship satisfaction.</citation_analysis></p>

          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Our findings are in line with previous research on sleep in men and women in general, with longer sleep and subjective reports of sleep disturbances in women, rather than previous research on sleep in parents of young children. Thus, we found no evidence of a sleep imbalance when both parents have similar working responsibilities.</citation_analysis></p>

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">In summary, a sleep imbalance between mothers and fathers of young children seems to be common, with the balance not restored until the children are considerably older. However, sleep has rarely been assessed objectively in both parents, and there is little knowledge of how working parents of young children sleep, and of who wakes up first at night because of the child’s needs. Furthermore, any effects of differences/inequalities in sleep between the parents on parental stress and relationship satisfaction have not previously been studied. This study was designed to determine whether there is a subjective and/or objective sleep imbalance between working mothers and fathers with young children, and whether such an imbalance predicts parental stress and relationship satisfaction.</citation_analysis></p>

        <title>Participants</title>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">A sample of 146 parents (73 couples) agreed to participate in the study. The final sample was 60 couples, after exclusion and data loss (see below), with a mean age of 37.6 years (SD=6.8 years). Each family had an average of 2 children (SD=1) and the age of the youngest child was on average 3.3 years old (SD=2.5 years). We advertised for parents of at least one child with disturbed sleep (mainly in digital meeting places set up to recruit potential volunteers, but also in social media groups for parents). Additional inclusion criteria were families with two parents where at least one of the parents claimed they woke up due to a child at least once per night for at least 4 nights a week, at least one child below the age of 12, that both parents were willing to participate in the study, and that both parents worked at least 80% of full time. We included both married couples and cohabiting non-married couples but excluded couples where either parent had a sleep disorder not related to the child. We also excluded participants who reported commonly using substances that could interfere with sleep, and those with poor physical or mental health. Participants were not required to be the biological parents of the child. The target population was recruited from Stockholm County in Sweden, primarily through various social media websites and a web billboard for research subject recruitment. Each parent received a movie ticket for their participation. The study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee in Stockholm (Dnr 2017/1742-31). The study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki. Data was collected between 2017 and 2019.</citation_analysis></p>

        <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">They were instructed to wear actigraphs (MotionWatch 8, CamNtech, Cambridge, UK) on their non-dominant wrist for 7 consecutive nights and were clearly instructed that they could at any time discontinue their participation in the study. Participants were told to wear the actigraph continuously, except when taking a shower or a bath. Some participants did not wear the actigraph during work due to hygiene restrictions.

          <title>Sleep – Actigraphy</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Sleep scoring was performed based on the MotionWare algorithm with a sensitivity threshold = 20. Actigraphy epoch duration for data acquisition was set to 30 sec (because of a mistake, 7 participants had an epoch setting of 60 sec). Epoch duration within couples was consistent in all but one. Data from this couple were excluded for the analysis of shared awakenings (see below) but retained for all the remaining analyses. On average, parents had actigraphy data that could be used for analysis on 6.5 nights out of 7. Objective total sleep time (TST) was the sleep time in minutes between falling asleep and final wake up. WASO was the sum of the time in the actigraphy epochs scored as wake between falling asleep and final wake up. Sleep efficiency was computed as the TST divided by the total time in bed (TIB) between falling asleep and final wake up.</citation_analysis></p>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">For shared awakenings within couples, we first applied thresholds with a minimum wake duration for awakenings (&gt;1 min and &gt;5 min, respectively) to every night of each participant separately. Only wake periods exceeding these thresholds were counted as wake periods. For each night within each couple, we then identified the time interval in which both partners were in bed simultaneously. Limited to this interval, we assessed how often wake epochs between partners overlapped in time. For each overlapping interval, we identified who woke up first (mother or father) or if both partners woke up simultaneously. Based on this procedure we derived the total number of shared awakenings and who woke up first during these shared awakenings, separately for both thresholds. All computations were performed using MATLAB (R2019a, MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). Sleep sufficiency index (%) was calculated by dividing the actigraphy TST with the stated habitual sleep need in the screening questionnaire and multiplying by 100.</citation_analysis></p>

Mothers have 28.0 min (SE=7.1, p&lt;0.001) longer objective sleep duration than men. Middle panel: Subjective sleep imbalance measurements based on questionnaire data. Couples are sorted as in the left panel. Mothers have 32.4 min (SE=9.3, p=0.001) longer subjective sleep duration than men. Right panel: Comparison between objective and subjective imbalance. Blue triangles represent objective couple-specific average imbalance and yellow triangles represent subjective measurements.

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The primary aim of this study was to determine whether there is a subjective and/or objective sleep imbalance between working mothers and fathers of young children. We found support for a subjective sleep imbalance in that mothers reported poorer sleep quality and having more waking periods, but with longer sleep duration, than fathers. However, only the sleep duration imbalance was confirmed by objective measures. Other objectively measured parameters showed no imbalance, neither in the number of wake periods nor WASO. Our finding that there is a sleep imbalance in subjective sleep quality and wake periods, unfavorable to the mother, is in line with previous research showing that mothers, and women in general, perceive their sleep as more disturbed than fathers/men do.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3–5</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> The results also confirm previous findings that women in general have longer subjective and objective sleep duration than men.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Previous research has suggested that the difference in sleep duration between men and women may diminish directly after the birth of a new child and then be slowly restored as the child grows older,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> and return to normal levels once the child is around 11 years old.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Our findings indicate that this happens earlier, once both parents are back to work after parental leave.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The second aim was to determine whether sleep imbalance predicts parental stress and relationship satisfaction. We found very little support for this, as sleep imbalance was not clearly related to parental stress or relationship satisfaction the following day, neither for mothers nor for fathers. The fact that we did not find such an association may be due to the lack of a consistent sleep imbalance in this group. A large imbalance in childcare involvement during the night may still lead to increased parental stress in both parents, but this has hardly been studied before. Although one study found that parental stress for both parents decreased when fathers increased their general involvement in the child,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> it remains unclear how the balance of night-specific tasks affects subjective and objective sleep, and impacts parents’ stress levels.</citation_analysis></p>

As mothers’ objectively measured sleep has been found to be associated with both children’s and fathers’ sleep, while fathers’ sleep is associated with the mothers’ but not the child’s sleep,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="negative"> one would expect mothers to wake up first when needing to tend to the child. Surprisingly, we found no difference in who woke up first during shared awakenings, neither for wake periods longer than 1 minute nor wake periods longer than 5 minutes. Although this way of measuring who wakes up first in mutual awakenings is based on intervals of 30 seconds and we are not able to assess who wakes up first within each interval, it indicates that there is no tendency for mothers or fathers to consistently wake up before their partner during the night. A limitation is that we could not directly relate these shared awakenings to a child’s awakenings, as we do not have data on the children’s sleep. It is possible that future and more detailed analyses, also including awakenings of the child, will shed light on the dynamics of how child awakenings affect when parents wake up during the night, and which parent tends to wake up first.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The paradox of women sleeping longer while perceiving their sleep as more disturbed has been attributed to differences in sex hormones, genetics, and cultural and social demands, but is not fully understood.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> One explanation may be that while women objectively sleep longer, they have an even longer preferred sleep duration.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Evidence of this comes, for example, from a questionnaire-based study of a large group of women and men, finding that women slept 14 minutes longer on workdays and 27 minutes longer on leisure days, but had 32 minutes longer preferred sleep duration than men.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> This is in line with our findings, showing that despite mothers’ sleeping longer than fathers, both parents considered their sleep as equally sufficient.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">One limitation with this study is that we did not measure the child’s sleep. Even though a child’s awakening is an external stressor that could wake up parents, there are of course many other potential reasons why parents wake up. Future studies would benefit from including measures of the child’s sleep in order to have a better understanding of what triggered the mutual awakenings of the parents. It is possible that other factors that may have affected both sleep and the study outcomes, such as daily variations in health or drug abuse. Although we screened participants for general health and drug use, we did not measure these directly, and they are thus potential confounds. Afurther limitation is the relatively small sample size. Fortunately, each couple has an average of 6.5 days (out of 7) of measures and the analyses are all within-couple, which strengthens our conclusions. Although this is one of the largest studies looking at objective sleep in both parents with regard to sample size and number of nights, and the only study focusing on parents of children between 1 and 12 years old, along with the effects of sleep imbalance, future studies would benefit from including a larger and more diverse sample of parents. As the study sample is also rather homogeneous, future studies would benefit from including more participants (or stratified sampling) in order to have the power to draw conclusions about these relationships in different groups. When it comes to limitation in measures, we used a single question on relationship interaction satisfaction taken from the Relationship Interaction Satisfaction scale.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Although this scale has been used previously to assess relationship satisfaction, there may be better ways to measure this aspect. One of the strengths of this study is the simultaneous use of objective measures of sleep in both parents, allowing for the assessment of within-couple sleep dynamics by looking at the epoch-by-epoch data. Considering that few studies have previously examined sleep in families where both parents work, it is a further strength that all participating parents were working at least 80% of full time. Although we did not find any large effects of imbalanced sleep in this study, the concept of sleep imbalance may be useful in other settings. For example, the effect of a sleep imbalance may be larger for parents on parental leave than for working parents, or in couples where sleep loss in general is bigger, such as for parents with younger children. It is also possible that larger sleep imbalances would be found in working parents from countries with less gender equality.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></citation_analysis></p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">This study finds that although there is an imbalance in subjective sleep quality, unfavorable to the mother, between working parents of young children, this was not observable in the corresponding actigraphy data. However, both the objective and subjective data on sleep length show that sleep length was longer in mothers. Overall, our findings are in line with previous research on sleep in men and women in general, rather than previous research on sleep in parents of young children. Our data indicate that when both parents are back to work, mothers do not show more objective sleep disturbances than fathers but have a longer sleep duration. Thus, there is little support for the existence of a sleep imbalance when both parents take similar working responsibilities. Future studies may benefit from taking account of who is the primary caregiver during the night, and the impact of different nighttime caregiving strategies on stress and sleep.</citation_analysis></p>
