      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">There are many uses for a sleep tracker that can accurately measure objective sleep in the home environment. For researchers, an accurate sleep tracker would enable research studies that are currently resource-heavy to be conducted more practically, including observational studies to explore sleep health with big data.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> For clinicians, an accurate sleep tracker may represent a substantially cheaper alternative to PSG for the monitoring of certain sleep disorders. For consumers, an accurate sleep tracker may allow individuals to monitor their sleep and benefit from individualised programs that incorporate their sleep tracker data and make recommendations to improve their sleep health. For individuals with insomnia, an accurate sleep tracker could assess the degree to which patients adhere with prescribed time in bed in the case of monitoring adherence to behavioural treatments. It is imperative that sleep trackers are accurate to ensure that any decisions made based on this data are appropriate, which is of even greater importance for diagnostic and treatment-related purposes. This article describes the development and accuracy of a new consumer sleep tracker, called THIM, for estimating sleep and wakefulness while in bed across the intended sleep period.</citation_analysis></p>

These typically wrist-worn devices contain an in-built accelerometer that quantifies wrist movement.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Individuals tend to remain relatively immobile when sleeping and move their limbs to a greater extent when awake. However, individuals also tend to lie still in bed whilst awake, particularly when they are close to initiating sleep.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> It is therefore unsurprising that these devices tend to overestimate sleep and underestimate wakefulness in most individuals.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> This can be particularly true for individuals that typically spend considerable durations of time in bed awake but inactive, such as those with insomnia,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> as noted in the American Academy of Sleep Medicine Clinical Practice Guidelines [see</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> for a comprehensive review]. For this reason, the accuracy of THIM will be examined with both good and poor sleepers to identify significant differences that may exist between groups.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Whilst the actigraphy method has limited sensitivity for estimating wakefulness, placing the device in a different body location to the traditional wrist placement may improve accuracy. The wrist was selected when actigraphy was developed in the 1980s because it could accommodate the relatively bulky devices at the time. Once algorithms were developed for scoring sleep from wrist movements, the wrist location perpetuated despite recent technology allowing miniaturisation of actigraphy to a smaller location, such as the finger. Wrist actigraphy devices typically only detect significant body movements involving the forearm. An actigraphy device placed on the finger may be able to detect much smaller movements from the hand and finger that occur during wakefulness and light stages of sleep, such as finger twitches.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> THIM differs from most common sleep trackers because it is worn on the index finger as opposed to the wrist and may consequently be more accurate than wrist actigraphy devices. Research with a similar finger-worn actigraphy device have found promising results for estimating sleep and wake.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Across 41 healthy adolescents/young adults, the OURA ring achieved a high sensitivity of 0.96 and a specificity of 0.48, which is at least comparable, if not better, performance than similar wrist-based devices for the adolescent population.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> We therefore predict that THIM may be more accurate than wrist-based actigraphy devices.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">This article described the development and accuracy of the THIM device for tracking sleep and wakefulness overnight compared to PSG. Two studies will be presented. Study 1 aimed to 1) develop the algorithm that THIM uses to track sleep and wakefulness, 2) test whether it performs differently to other actigraphy devices, and 3) assess the impact of insomnia symptoms on device performance. This was investigated by dichotomising participants into good and poor sleeper groups based on their scores on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). The potential uses of THIM for these two groups differ, and therefore, it is more meaningful for the interpretation of the study findings to consider good and poor sleepers separately. Study 2 provides preliminary evidence about the accuracy of THIM in an independent sample of healthy individuals with self-reported good or poor sleep. Importantly, the validation was conducted on an entirely independent sample from that used to develop the algorithm in Study 1.</citation_analysis></p>

To retrieve this data, the device is connected via Bluetooth to the accompanying THIM smartphone application (app). Data is sent to cloud-based servers for further processing, during which a sleep tracking algorithm is applied to score every 30-second epoch into sleep or wake. This information is subsequently displayed on the THIM app as key sleep parameters – total sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep efficiency (SE) – and as a visual sleep hypnogram.</citation_analysis></p>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">For this study, the THIM smartphone app (v 1.0.1) was operated on an Apple iPhone 5s model (iOS 8.0 operating system) to upload the 30-second epoch data to the cloud-based servers. At present, the epoch data is not readily accessible for download. The manufacturers of THIM, Re-Time Pty. Ltd., retrieved and forwarded the data to us for the purpose of this study. The sleep periods were determined from the lights out/lights on times recorded on the laboratory night. We then developed the THIM sleep tracking algorithm on this data, which is applied to the THIM data in the cloud-based servers (from firmware v 1.0.4).</citation_analysis></p>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">To create the algorithm, we first developed a smoothing function applied to pre-processed data (data after high and low pass filter processing) by iteratively adjusting the number of included previous and subsequent epochs and their weightings in the smoothing function until the algorithm reached high agreement with PSG for estimating sleep and wake periods. Secondly, a threshold applied to the epoch data to distinguish between sleep and wake epochs was identified by iteratively adjusting the threshold until acceptable sensitivity and specificity was reached across the whole sample. Thirdly, specific scoring criteria regarding the number of “wake” epochs required to determine SOL and subsequent awakenings were iteratively adjusted until high correspondence was obtained between PSG and THIM across this sample. The algorithm cannot be discussed in greater detail as it is proprietary.</citation_analysis></p>

      <title>Study 1: Discussion</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Study 1 aimed to develop the THIM sleep tracking algorithm and compare its accuracy to two popular actigraphy devices. The epoch-by-epoch analysis revealed that THIM was less sensitive for detecting sleep compared to the Fitbit Flex and Actiwatch devices but had higher specificity and comparable overall accuracy. Analysis of the sleep parameter estimations further demonstrated that THIM aligned closely with PSG, with no significant differences between THIM and PSG for any sleep parameter. In comparison, the Fitbit Flex and Actiwatch Spectrum devices’ estimations of SOL were significantly lower than PSG, and the Fitbit Flex’s estimations of WASO and SE differed to PSG. Overall, these findings suggest that THIM has comparable accuracy to the Actiwatch and Fitbit Flex devices, with perhaps greater agreement with PSG for estimating key sleep parameters. However, the THIM sleep tracking algorithm was developed and optimised for estimating sleep and wake with this sample. As such, the device may not be as accurate with a different sample of healthy individuals. To draw stronger conclusions about the accuracy of THIM, the device needed to be tested with a separate sample. This was addressed in Study 2.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">This study examined whether this high variability across individuals evident on the Bland–Altman plots could be due to the type of sleeper (good or poor sleeper). There was only one significant difference between good and poor sleepers across the dependent variables for the actigraphy devices – THIM showed significantly lower sensitivity for poor sleepers. Nonetheless, sleeper characteristics is an important factor that has impacted the accuracy of actigraphy devices in previous research,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> although some studies have found no significant differences between good sleepers and those with insomnia.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Further investigation is warranted to understand the suitability of THIM for monitoring the sleep of individuals with good or poor sleep.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">The aims of Study 2 were three-fold: to 1) test the accuracy of the THIM algorithm developed in Study 1 with an independent sample, 2) determine whether the device is more accurate than other actigraphy devices, and 3) investigate whether the accuracy of the actigraphy devices differ between good and poor sleepers.</citation_analysis></p>

The TST plots indicate that THIM appears to have a mean bias towards underestimating TST compared to the Actiwatch-2 device with a mean bias close to zero and the Fitbit Alta device with a mean bias greater than zero. Yet, considering the findings above, these biases do not produce estimation of TST that are significantly different to PSG. The WASO plots illustrate lines of best fit with steep negative slopes (ie, significant proportional bias), though this is potentially driven by the presence of an outlier. The SE plots further illustrate that THIM had a small bias towards underestimating sleep efficiency, while the other devices overestimated sleep efficiency.

      <title>Study 2: Discussion</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The first aim of Study 2 was to test the accuracy of THIM with an independent sample. THIM had slightly lower sensitivity compared to the findings from Study 1, reflecting a greater bias towards scoring sleep epochs as wake in this independent sample. However, this greater bias did not produce estimates of sleep parameters that significantly differed from PSG. The THIM Bland–Altman plots appeared comparable between Study 1 and Study 2, with high variability in the discrepancy between PSG and THIM shown across all sleep parameters (evident by the wide levels of agreement). Together, these findings suggest that THIM was similar in accuracy for estimating sleep and wake in the independent sample as the sample from which the algorithm was developed.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The second aim of Study 2 was to compare the accuracy of THIM to the Fitbit Alta and Actiwatch-2 devices. THIM had lower sensitivity yet higher specificity than the Fitbit device. Overall, THIM was slightly lower in accuracy than the Acitwatch-2 device. The Bland–Altman plots also indicated that THIM had a bias towards underestimating TST and SE, and overestimating WASO compared to the other two actigraphy devices that overestimated sleep. Notably, all three devices performed better on the sleep parameter estimations than on the epoch-by-epoch statistics, demonstrating the need to assess device performance using agreement rather than correspondence statistics. These findings contrast previous research with Fitbit and Actiwatch devices that demonstrate a bias towards overestimating sleep and underestimating wake.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24–27</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Further, differences in the findings from the current study compared to previous research may be due to differences between algorithms or device placement, or both, between THIM and other actigraphy devices. For instance, the presence of finger twitches during REM sleep may explain the trend towards overestimating WASO, as period of REM may have been miss-scored as wake.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0010">10</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Further research could investigate whether the presence of finger twitches during REM sleep correspond with wake periods identified by a finger-worn actigraphy device.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Study 2 also aimed to determine whether there were any differences in the accuracy of these devices between good and poor sleepers. Similar to the findings of Study 1, there were no significant differences between good and poor sleepers for any of the dependent variables across actigraphy devices. This contrasts with previous research where actigraphy devices were less accurate for those with a range of sleep problems compared to good sleepers,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> particularly when assessed in people with insomnia.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Such differences between studies may be due to the algorithm used to score the actigraphy data, as noted in reviews of this area.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Further research is warranted to assess not only device accuracy but also algorithm accuracy across sleep disordered populations compared to good sleepers.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="negative">Nonetheless, as found in Study 1, there is still considerably high variability in agreement on the Bland–Altman plots for all actigraphy devices. The limits of agreement ranged from a minimum of 58 minutes for SOL, 112 minutes for TST, 113 minutes for WASO, and 20% for sleep efficiency across the actigraphy devices. Whilst there are no current recommendations about acceptable limits of agreement for actigraphy devices</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="negative"> this degree of variability is presumably not acceptable to appropriately substitute for PSG, particularly when interpreting the data at the individual level.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="negative"> Additional individual characteristics that theoretically may explain high variability in the accuracy of actigraphy devices include age, gender, BMI, and the presence of sleep disorders.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> In additional LMM analyses, the main effects of gender and BMI were not significant across any of the sleep parameters, and therefore, these factors do not explain the variability in this sample. Due to none of the participants having a sleep disorder and a small age range, these factors are likely to have a small effect size in the current study.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Regarding the limitations of the current study, the PSG data were scored by one qualified sleep technician. The interrater reliability of PSG sleep scoring amongst qualified individuals can be low,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> increasing the error of measurement of our gold standard measure. Additionally, the sample size was low compared to other validation studies. These limitations should be considered when interpreting differences between devices and when generalising the findings of the current study to the general population.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Importantly, THIM has not been tested for people with insomnia and could be assessed in future research. Studies could also investigate night-to-night variability in the accuracy of THIM, which is particularly important to assess since people with insomnia have high variability in sleep across nights.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Additionally, considering that people with insomnia experience different sleep quality in the sleep laboratory compared to their home environments,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> it is particularly important to test THIM in individuals’ homes. Future studies could also collect data from larger, more heterogenous samples to provide stronger conclusions about the accuracy of THIM than the present studies.

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The two current studies aimed to develop (Study 1) and provide preliminary evidence for the accuracy (Study 2) of the THIM wearable device for estimating sleep and wakefulness. With an independent sample in Study 2, THIM had slightly lower sensitivity compared to the findings with the algorithm training sample in Study 1. However, specificity remained relatively high compared to other actigraphy devices. The studies also examined whether THIM performed comparably to two popular actigraphy devices: the Actiwatch and Fitbit devices. In these preliminary studies, it appears that THIM is relatively similar in accuracy for estimating sleep and wake compared to the Actiwatch and Fitbit devices. However, THIM showed a tendency towards underestimating sleep and overestimating wakefulness. Whilst these studies did not find differences in the accuracy of actigraphy devices between good and poor sleepers, there was high variability in the devices’ accuracies between individuals that could be explored in future research. The accuracy of THIM for estimating sleep and wake in individuals with insomnia could also be explored to further the long-term goal of improving the treatment of insomnia.</citation_analysis></p>
