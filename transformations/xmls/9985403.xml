          <title>Purpose</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The commercialization of sleep activity tracking devices has made it possible to manage sleep quality at home. However, it is necessary to verify the reliability and accuracy of wearable devices through comparison with polysomnography (PSG), which is the standard for tracking sleep activity. This study aimed to monitor overall sleep activity using Fitbit Inspire 2™ (FBI2) and to evaluate its performance and effectiveness through PSG under the same conditions.</citation_analysis></p>

        <sec>
          <title>Patients and Methods</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">We compared the FBI2 and PSG data of nine participants (four male and five female participants; average age, 39 years) without severe sleeping problems. The participants wore FBI2 continuously for 14 days, considering the period of adaptation to the device. FBI2 and PSG sleep data were compared using paired </citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><italic toggle="yes">t</italic></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">-tests, Bland–Altman plots, and epoch-by-epoch analysis for 18 samples by pooling data from two replicates.</citation_analysis></p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The average values for each sleep stage obtained from FBI2 and PSG showed significant differences in the total sleep time (TST), deep sleep, and rapid eye motion (REM). In the Bland–Altman analysis, TST (</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><italic toggle="yes">P</italic></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> = 0.02), deep sleep (</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><italic toggle="yes">P</italic></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> = 0.05), and REM (</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><italic toggle="yes">P</italic></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> = 0.03) were significantly overstated in FBI2 compared to PSG. In addition, time in bed, sleep efficiency, and wake after sleep onset were overestimated, while light sleep was underestimated. However, these differences were not statistically significant. FBI2 showed a high sensitivity (93.9%) and low specificity (13.1%), with an accuracy of 76%. The sensitivity and specificity of each sleep stage was 54.3% and 62.3%, respectively, for light sleep, 84.8% and 50.1%, respectively, for deep sleep, and 86.4% and 59.1%, respectively for REM sleep.</citation_analysis></p>

          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The use of FBI2 as an objective tool for measuring sleep in daily life can be considered appropriate. However, further research is warranted on its application in participants with sleep-wake problems.</citation_analysis></p>

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Certain differences exist in the reliability and accuracy based on the Fitbit model; hence, many comparative studies using PSG have been reported to evaluate the effectiveness of Fitbit.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Overall, Fitbit showed high sensitivity (0.95–0.96) and relatively low specificity (0.58–0.69) for sleep detection in a meta-analysis of the accuracy of Fitbit and PSG, which can evaluate sleep stages. Wake time after sleep onset (WASO), total sleep time (TST), and sleep efficiency (SE) did not differ from those of PSG.

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Nevertheless, studies comparing the validity of Fitbit and PSG are limited because most studies were one-time experiments.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> In addition, the first-night effect occurred in 50% of the participants, as the experiment was conducted in an unfamiliar laboratory different from the familiar environment at night.

In the Fitbit, wake was retained as wake, and light, deep, and REM were changed to sleep. In addition, because the time interval between the epoch measurements was not the same, the epoch measurement time interval for each method was changed to 30s before recording. When both wake and sleep stages were measured in the 30-second block, they were coded as wake stages. Agreement, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were evaluated using the classified data.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></citation_analysis></p>

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">In this study, we compared the results of FBI2 with those of PSG through two repeated experiments at intervals of one week under the same conditions to evaluate the effectiveness of sleep and wake measurement function of FBI2 in nine participants without sleep disorders. This is a supplementary study verifying Fitbit’s accuracy. The two main results of this study are as follows: First, the FBI2 variables TST, deep sleep, and REM sleep were significantly overestimated. Second, the total sleep result showed a sensitivity of 93.9%, specificity of 13.1%, and accuracy of 76.0%. Therefore, the accuracy of each sleep parameter was determined.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Bland–Altman’s comparison evaluated the performance of FBI2 through sleep variables for PSG, which was consistent with the results of Bland–Altman’s paired </citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><italic toggle="yes">t</italic></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive">-test. The study results showed significant differences in TST, deep sleep, and REM sleep among the sleep variables measured twice using PSG and FBI2.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The mean difference between FBI2 and PSG in the TST was 17.9 minutes and 14.67 minutes in deep sleep, which was significantly overestimated. Previous studies have shown that there is a significant mean difference between the PSG and sleep measurement wearable devices, wherein sleep measurement wearable devices make that overestimation. In a previous study that performed PSG using the Fitbit Alta HR on 49 participants, TST and deep sleep were significantly overestimated, similar to the results obtained in this study.18 In addition, SE was 4.15%, and WASO was 10.36 minutes, which was overestimated. WASO is mainly found in patients with sleep disorders; in previous studies when comparing WASO with insomnia and healthy individuals, in the healthy individual group, the standard deviation was found to be greater than the average value.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> In addition, other previous studies have demonstrated the standard deviation to be large; moreover, no significant results were explained as a limitation of the small number of participants.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Considering the limitations of this study, the number of participants was small, and the average value of WASO was determined to be greater than the standard deviation by analyzing the general public.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The Bland–Altman plot was included in the 95% confidence interval, indicating a constant value. This is contrary to the results of a previous study in which the agreement between the Fitbit and PSG was lower as WASO increased in the Bland–Altman plot when the Fitbit Alta HR device was used for patients with insomnia. This conflicting result might be because the participants in this study did not have sleep disorders.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="negative"> Therefore, the accuracy was confirmed to be high when FBI2 was used in participants with sleep disturbance. Light sleep was underestimated by −6.36. In a previous study that compared Withings Pulse O2 with PSG in 40 healthy adults, light sleep (average bias of 79 min) was also underestimated, which is similar to the results of this study.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The sensitivity of the participants for the total sleep stage of FBI2 was 93.9%, indicating that sleep was accurately detected. However, the specificity for detecting total sleep stage was relatively low (13.1%). This is consistent with the results of the evaluation of the sleep effectiveness of the wrist-worn wearable device based on PSG results. Therefore, it was verified that these devices could accurately measure sleep owing to their high overall sensitivity and low specificity.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> The low specificity of the Fitbit is related to the perception of sleep when there is no movement. However, the latest Fitbit detected more accurately the wake epoch, or WASO, during sleep.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Nevertheless, compared with the results of other studies using Fitbit with a similar algorithm, the sensitivity in this study was similar. However, the specificity (0.58 to 0.69) is slightly lower.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Therefore, although repetitive measurements were performed in this study, it can be inferred that the subject slept with minimal movement in an uncomfortable state in hospital-based laboratories, unlike sleep at home.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">The first-night effect is mainly observed in patients with insomnia, and this study was conducted in the general public; thus, the first night effect was not substantially applied.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> However, the results were compared by repeated measurements to collect accurate sleep information using sleep polysomnography based on previous studies that demonstrated the sleep polymorphism test record to be critical for two consecutive days.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> The test results of the first and second visits were similar in the participants of this study; thus, the first night effect did not appear (the results are not presented).</citation_analysis></p>

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The advantages of this study are as follows: First, by comparing Fitbit and PSG for Koreans, the sleep characteristics of Koreans were reflected in the same environmental conditions.

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="negative">The limitations of this study are as follows: First, because this was an exploratory study with only nine participants, the sample size was small, which may have affected the accurate comparison of the FBI2 and PSG. Therefore, we analyzed the total number of participants measured per visit to compensate for this limitation. Second, the accuracy was relatively low because of the characteristics of the FBI2 device, the sleep measurement mode of which was not classified in detail. Third, the sleep parameters of the Fitbit were defined arbitrarily, unlike the interpretation of PSG polysomnographic technologists. Therefore, there were limitations to this interpretation.</citation_analysis></p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">This study compared sleep PSG and FBI2 with repeated measurements in the same sleep experimental environment in adults who felt uncomfortable with sleep. This study is meaningful in that it is the first exploratory study to verify the accuracy of the FBI2 and found the possibility of its use as an objective sleep indicator. By demonstrating nearly consistent results with previous studies upon comparison with Fitbit and PSG, the FBI2 can be used to monitor sleep health owing to its usability aspect, thereby supporting its use as an alternative to PSG.</citation_analysis></p>
