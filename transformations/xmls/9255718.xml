          <title>Purpose</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Due to lack of access and high cost of polysomnography, portable sleep apnea testing has been developed to diagnose sleep apnea. Despite being less expensive, and having fewer sensors and reasonable accuracy in identifying sleep apnea, such devices can be less accurate than polysomnography in detecting apneas/hypopneas. To increase the accuracy of apnea/hypopnea detection, an accurate airflow estimation is required. However, current airflow measurement techniques employed in portable devices are inconvenient and subject to displacement during sleep. In this study, algorithms were developed to estimate respiratory motion and airflow using tracheo-sternal motion and tracheal sounds.</citation_analysis></p>

          <title>Patients and Methods</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Adults referred for polysomnography were included. Simultaneous to polysomnography, a patch device with an embedded 3-dimensional accelerometer and microphone was affixed to the suprasternal notch to record tracheo-sternal motion and tracheal sounds, respectively. Tracheo-sternal motion was used to train two mathematical models for estimating changes in respiratory motion and airflow compared to simultaneously measured thoracoabdominal motion and nasal pressure from polysomnography. The amplitude of the estimated airflow was then adjusted by the tracheal sound envelope in segments with unstable breathing.</citation_analysis></p>

          <title>Results</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Two hundred and fifty-two subjects participated in this study. Overall, the algorithms provided highly accurate estimates of changes in respiratory motion and airflow with mean square errors (MSE) of 3.58 ± 0.82% and 2.82 ± 0.71%, respectively, compared to polysomnographic signals. The estimated motion and airflow from the patch signals detected apneas and hypopneas scored on polysomnography in 63.9% and 88.3% of cases, respectively.</citation_analysis></p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Sleep apnea (SA) is characterized by intermittent reductions (hypopneas) or cessations (apneas) in airflow during sleep. Sleep apnea occurs due to partial or complete collapse of the upper airway (UA) (obstructive sleep apnea, OSA) or reduction or cessation in central neural stimulation of inspiratory muscles (central sleep apnea, CSA) during sleep. While SA is present in approximately 10% of the adult population,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> it is more prevalent in individuals with certain medical conditions such as heart failure (47–81%</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">), hypertension (73–82%</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">), and stroke (71%</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">). Attended overnight polysomnography (PSG) in a sleep laboratory is the standard method to diagnose sleep apnea, but is inconvenient owing to its high expense and relative inaccessibility in many areas.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> This helps to explain why approximately 85% of the people with sleep apnea remain undiagnosed.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">To overcome the challenges of SA diagnosis, portable sleep apnea testing has been developed. Such testing devices have fewer sensors and are less expensive compared to PSG, while not requiring an overnight stay in a sleep laboratory. Despite having reasonable accuracy in identifying subjects with SA,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> such devices can be less accurate in detecting apneas and hypopneas. To increase the accuracy of apnea/hypopnea detection, accurate estimation of respiratory signals is required.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Current portable devices generally use nasal pressure cannulae for measuring airflow and/or respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) for measuring respiratory motion. However, nasal cannulae only measures nasal airflow and will not detect airflow when subjects are mouth breathing.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="negative"> In unattended sleep monitoring at home, nasal cannulae and RIP bands can be displaced during the night so that signals may either be inconsistent or lost.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Alternative means of measuring airflow and respiratory motion are via recording of tracheal motion and breath sounds by a 3-dimensional accelerometer and a microphone, respectively.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10–16</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Such tracheal signals have been used in prototype portable devices to detect SA. Furthermore, tracheal breath sounds have been assessed to estimate airflow; however, such assessments were performed during wakefulness under carefully controlled conditions</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> or during brief segments of sleep.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> A few studies also suggested the possibility that a combination of tracheal sounds and motion could be used to estimate airflow during overnight sleep studies.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Accordingly, in the present study, we employed a module, the patch, into which is embedded a 3-dimensional accelerometer and a microphone, that is affixed to the skin over the suprasternal notch and upper sternum for recording the craniocaudal motion of the trachea and posterior-anterior motion of the sternum, as well as tracheal breath sounds. The objective of the study was to develop algorithms to estimate respiratory motion and airflow using tracheo-sternal motion and tracheal sounds compared to simultaneously recorded reference signals from overnight PSG.

        <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Following instrumentation for PSG, a module into which a 3-dimensional accelerometer and a microphone were embedded, the patch (BresoDX1, BresoTEC Inc., Toronto, Canada), was affixed over the suprasternal notch and upper sternum by adhesive tape (</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">) to record tracheo-sternal motion and tracheal sound.

          <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">For each segment of data, craniocaudal (X-axis) and posterior-anterior (Z-axis) motion from the accelerometer and sound signals from the microphone were extracted. To ensure tracheal motion signals were related to breathing in the frequency range from 0.2 to 0.33 Hz,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> accelerometer signals were filtered using a five-order zero-phase bandpass Butterworth filter with a bandwidth of 0.2 to 5 Hz. Then, the filtered accelerometer signals were down-sampled to 10 Hz and deemed movement signals. We found 10 Hz sufficient to preserve the clear waveform of breathing. At this stage, each movement signal consisted of the breathing-related movements, which were superimposed on a baseline level which could rise or fall abruptly with changes in body position during sleep. Such shifts in the baseline were detected using the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) technique.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> The PELT algorithm used the root mean squared error as the cost function to optimally partition each movement signal into segments with different baselines. Each segment between two consecutive shifts in the signal baseline was normalized between its 2nd and 98th percentiles. The normalization unified the amplitude range of the movement signals and equalized the baseline at the zero level during different body postures. Subsequently, the normalized segments were temporally combined to generate the normalized movement signals (M</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><sub>X</sub></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> and M</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><sub>Z</sub></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">) in X and Z axes with unified range and zero-level baseline.</citation_analysis></p>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The sound signal was bandpass filtered using a nine-order zero-phase Butterworth filter (200–2000 Hz).

To remove the remaining spectral content of heart sounds and snoring, the filtered sound was resampled at 10 Hz. The envelope of the resampled sound signal was extracted for each sample by finding the maximum value within a neighborhood of 10 seconds. The 10-second window ensured capturing the oscillation related to breathing with 0.2–5 second period. Subsequently, the logarithm of the extracted envelope (S</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><sub>E</sub></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">) was normalized based on the 5th and 95th percentile to remove spikes related to noise disturbances.</citation_analysis></p>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">From the synchronized segment of PSG data, the corresponding electronic sum of thoracoabdominal movements (respiratory motion) and nasal pressure (airflow) were extracted and resampled at 10 Hz.

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Unlike previous studies that estimated airflow from tracheal sound, we used a composite of tracheo-sternal motion and sound for this purpose. Airflow estimation using sound energy is challenging; first due to the difference between the polarity of airflow amplitude and sound energy in the respiratory phases. The amplitude of airflow is negative and positive during inspiration and expiration, respectively, while sound energy always has a positive amplitude. Therefore, the first step to estimate airflow using tracheal sound is to identify respiratory phases.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Hence, in segments with misidentified respiratory phases the accuracy of airflow estimation is compromised. Second, sound is affected by the presence of snoring, which is associated with an abrupt elevation in the level and change in the shape of the sound energy.

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">In contrast, the patch accelerometer detected craniocaudal motion of the trachea and anterior-posterior respiratory motion of the sternum that are less affected by snoring and, similar to airflow signals, their polarity changes in accordance with respiratory phases. Consequently, we found that tracheo-sternal motion measured by the patch provided a better estimate of airflow than tracheal sounds alone. Nevertheless, we found that the accuracy of airflow estimates improved when the amplitude of the estimated airflow from tracheo-sternal motion was adjusted by the envelope of the tracheal sounds in segments with unstable breathing. Such improvement in the accuracy was presumably related to the well-established relationship between airflow and sound energy.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Furthermore, to remove the effect of sleep stages and body posture, we used PELT, which can detect the changes in the signal dynamic with time instant resolution. By employing the PELT technique and modulating the estimated airflow by the sound envelope, the amplitude of the estimated airflow was shown to be significantly lower during respiratory events (</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">).</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">In another study, a different approach was used in which a linear regression model was trained using tracheal motion and sound energy to estimate the range of the sum of thoracoabdominal motion.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> The estimated range of movements was an index with values between 0 (for apnea) to 1 (for normal breathing). In contrast, in this study, the motion estimation model was trained using the sum of movements to capture the rising and falling patterns related to inspirations and expirations. This approach effectively increased the agreement between the estimated and reference motion quantified by repeated measure correlation compared to the previous study,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> especially during hypopneas and normal breathing during sleep and wakefulness.

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Estimated motion was less sensitive at detecting respiratory events compared to the estimated airflow. This is presumably because most of the events were obstructive during which thoracoabdominal and tracheal movements continue during obstructed efforts. In some instances, this would have been misclassified as normal breathing. However, since tracheal breath sounds will diminish during obstructive events, it adds sensitivity to tracheal motion for detecting obstructive events. During central events, especially apneas, there is no or very little thoracoabdominal or tracheal motion. As a consequence, there is a greater reduction in tracheal motion during central than obstructive events as demonstrated in </citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">. Therefore, whereas estimated airflow can be used to detect respiratory events of all types, it might be possible to use estimated motion to differentiate central from obstructive events.</citation_analysis></p>

One interesting observation was that tracheo-sternal signals could sense and estimate airflow even at lower airflow rates where nasal pressure was not sensitive.

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Despite the random selection of subjects for training and test sets, there were marginal differences in sex and BMI. However, they had no impact on development of the models since similar adjusted MSE values were obtained for sex and BMI subgroups. For example, overall, the algorithms provided highly accurate estimates of airflow and motion in the test set with MSEs of 2.82 ± 0.71% and 3.58 ± 0.82%, respectively.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">This study has some limitations. First, snoring can interfere with the analysis of airflow assessed by tracheal sound. Because we did not identify and quantify snoring, we did not specifically filter it out. However, we used several strategies to mitigate any potential adverse effect of snoring on our model of airflow estimation. These included use of tracheo-sternal movements as our main signal, which are less sensitive to snoring than tracheal sounds, filtering of the tracheal sounds in a range that would at least partially filter out snoring, and applying tracheal sound modulation to tracheo-sternal motion only during unstable breathing. Second, we were not able to clearly distinguish central from obstructive respiratory events from estimated motion and airflow signals. However, the observation that tracheo-sternal motion was lower during central than obstructive events suggests that algorithms can be developed to distinguish central from obstructive respiratory events in our future work. Third, since our study was designed primarily to assess accuracy of tracheo-sternal motion and sound in estimating respiratory airflow, we did not use oximetry in this study. Addition of oximetry to the patch signals will likely improve respiratory event detection, which will be addressed in future studies.</citation_analysis></p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">To our knowledge, this is the first study to estimate respiratory motion and airflow from tracheo-sternal motion and sound recordings during complete overnight PSG. We demonstrated that use of such signals provides highly accurate and robust estimates of changes in airflow during wakefulness and sleep for both normal breathing, and for unstable breathing with apneas and hypopneas. Furthermore, our findings support the potential for tracheo-sternal motion and sound recordings to automatically detect respiratory events during sleep and classify them as obstructive or central. If so, the patch device could provide a novel, accurate, simple and easy-to-use means of portable sleep apnea testing. Finally, the patch provides excellent visual representation of respiratory motion and airflow. Therefore, technicians and physicians could inspect these signals to increase the accuracy of event detection and assessment of sleep apnea severity beyond automatic scoring.</citation_analysis></p>
