          <title>Background</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Insomnia is a common issue among individuals with mental health conditions, yet the frequency of insomnia treatment remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of probable insomnia, discussions regarding sleep with health professionals, and the utilisation of commonly delivered insomnia treatments in Australian adults diagnosed with mental health conditions.</citation_analysis></p>

        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">This study represents a secondary analysis of data collected through a cross-sectional, national online survey conducted in 2019. A subset included participants (n = 624, age 18–85y) who self-reported a diagnosis of depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, panic disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder. Participants were classed as having probable insomnia based on self-reported symptoms and a minimum availability of 7.5 hours in bed.</citation_analysis></p>

          <title>Results</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Among individuals with probable insomnia (n = 296, 47.4%), 64.5% (n = 191) reported discussing sleep with one or more health professionals, predominantly with general practitioners (n = 160, 83.8%). However, 35.4% (n = 105) of people with probable insomnia had not discussed their sleep with a health professional. Additionally, 35.1% (n = 104) used prescribed medication for sleep, while only 15.9% (n = 47) had used the first line recommended treatment of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia in the last 12 months.</citation_analysis></p>

        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Although most participants who met the criteria for probable insomnia had engaged in discussions about sleep with health professionals, utilisation of first line recommended treatment was low. Interventions that promote routine assessment of sleep and first line treatment for insomnia by health professionals would likely benefit people with mental health conditions.</citation_analysis></p>

      <title>Plain Language Summary</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Insomnia is a prevalent issue among individuals with mental health conditions. However, the extent to which individuals with mental health conditions and insomnia engage in discussions about sleep with health professionals remains unclear. This study was a secondary analysis of a national survey conducted in Australia in 2019, revealing that nearly half (47.4%) of participants with mental health conditions met the criteria for probable insomnia.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Among those with probable insomnia, approximately 64.5% reported having discussions about sleep with a health professional. However, only 16% of individuals with probable insomnia used the recommended first line treatment of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia techniques. Barriers such as cost and lack of a referral by a general practitioner were commonly cited as reasons for not accessing psychological interventions.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Additionally, the type of treatment used was associated with daytime symptoms of insomnia. This finding suggests the importance of investigating health professionals’ perceptions of daytime insomnia symptoms, as these perceptions may influence treatment decisions. Overall, this study highlights that probable insomnia is highly prevalent among individuals with mental health conditions. While discussing sleep with health professionals appears relatively common within this population, generally discussions do not translate to first line treatment. Further research and interventions focusing on improving sleep assessment and access to appropriate treatments are warranted.</citation_analysis></p>

        <title>Sample and Recruitment Procedure</title>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Recruitment and data collection were conducted between March and April 2019, by Dynata (previously Research Now Survey Sampling International – SSI), the largest first-party data company internationally, including a panel of over 500,000 Australian survey takers. Potential participants were initially screened for broad inclusion criteria: at least 18 years of age, an Australian citizen or permanent resident, and able to access the online survey. The final sample (n = 2044) was selected via a three-stage process to minimize the risk of sample bias: (1) randomly selected participants completed a demographic profiling survey, (2) demographic information was then used to identify appropriate participants for the sleep survey; and (3) selected participants were invited via the Dynata participant interface to complete the web-based sleep survey. Participants were blind to the content of the survey prior to participation to reduce risk of bias associated with self-selection. All participants confirmed consent to continue to the survey. Sample recruitment methods have previously been reported in detail using the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES) (see </citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><underline><ext-link xlink:href="https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=412468.docx" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Material</ext-link></underline></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive">).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The objective of this study was to examine the prevalence and predictors of discussions about sleep with health professionals and the utilisation of sleep treatments among a sample of Australian adults with mental health conditions. Out of the 624 participants who reported ever being diagnosed with a mental health condition, nearly half (47.4%) met the criteria for probable insomnia, with 53.9% currently experiencing mental health difficulties. Participants with probable insomnia were more likely to have discussed sleep with a health professional in the last 12 months and more likely to have engaged in multiple discussions on the topic. Among those with probable insomnia, 64.5% had discussed sleep with a health professional within the past 12 months, primarily with a general practitioner. However, despite the relatively high rates of discussions about sleep, a discrepancy was evident between these discussions and self-reported sleep treatment utilisation within the past 12 months. Approximately one-third of participants with probable insomnia (35.1%) reported using sleep medication, while only 15.9% reported using cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi) techniques. This finding indicates a notable gap between discussing sleep and receiving appropriate treatment among individuals with mental health conditions who meet the criteria for probable insomnia.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">A higher percentage of individuals with probable insomnia engaged in discussions about sleep with health professionals compared to the general population (64.5% vs 30.0%).</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> While this is an encouraging finding, a significant proportion of individuals with probable insomnia reported that they did not discuss their sleep with a health professional within the past 12 months. This suggests that there is still room for improvement in terms of rates of discussions about sleep among individuals with probable insomnia. Treatment for insomnia has been shown to improve various mental health symptoms, regardless of whether insomnia is the primary complaint, implying that addressing sleep-related issues can have beneficial effects on both sleep and other mental health presentations.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Therefore, increasing the rates of discussions about sleep and ensuring appropriate treatment for insomnia among individuals with mental health conditions may offer benefits for both sleep quality and mental health outcomes. In the present study, difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep were a primary driver for discussing sleep. Therefore, those with night-time insomnia symptoms but no daytime symptoms may still seek to improve their sleep by discussing it with a health professional. However, sensitivity analysis revealed that daytime symptoms, some of which overlap with current mental health difficulties, were also a driver for discussing sleep.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Despite two-thirds of individuals meeting the criteria for probable insomnia reporting discussing sleep with health professionals, few reported using CBTi techniques, which is the recommended first line treatment for insomnia symptoms. More than 50% of those who met the criteria for probable insomnia but did not access psychological or psychiatric services provided reasons for this. While general practitioners often manage insomnia symptoms through sleep hygiene education and prescribing medication, the provision of comprehensive sleep care can be challenging when patients present with other mental and physical health conditions due to time constraints and limited funding. Additionally, research has shown that general practitioners may have limited knowledge of CBTi and referral pathways, which can contribute to the underutilisation of this effective treatment option.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Moreover, it has been reported that Australian health professionals receive limited training in providing sleep care.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> For example, a study conducted in 2021 among postgraduate psychology students in Australia (n = 138) reported that students received a median of only one hour of sleep education training, with almost half (47%) receiving no training at all.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> In summary, our study indicates that discussions about sleep are frequently initiated with health professionals, but this does not necessarily translate to the utilisation of first line treatment (CBTi). The lack of translation to treatment may be attributed to multiple factors, including constraints in time and funding for individual general practitioners, insufficient referral pathways,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> and the complexities associated with co-occurring mental health issues.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Health professionals face various barriers in providing sleep care and referring patients for CBTi, particularly among individuals with mental health conditions.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> However, it is important to note that consumers also encounter barriers when accessing and receiving sleep care provision and CBTi.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Among participants who did not discuss their sleep with a psychologist or psychiatrist, cost concerns emerged as the most commonly reported reason. In Australia, general practitioners can prescribe sleep medication and, through the Better Access initiative, issue a Mental Health Treatment Plan, which provides access to and rebates for an initial ten sessions of treatment with a psychologist.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> CBTi incurs an initial higher cost, however improvements last over time, with prescribed sleep medication incurring higher costs over the long term.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Further insight is needed to identify both clinician and consumer perceptions regarding the cost and access pathways to psychological treatment for insomnia. This is particularly salient for people with mental health conditions, who are more likely to be engaging with health services</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> and have a low income.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Individuals with probable insomnia and current mental health difficulties were more likely to report using sleep medication, regardless of the presence of daytime symptoms. People with probable insomnia were also more likely to have used CBTi techniques, albeit at much lower rates (15.9%). However, people with DIMS and TIB ≥7.5 hours only and current mental health difficulties were not more likely to use CBTi techniques. Therefore, the presence of daytime symptoms may have influenced the likelihood of receiving first line psychological treatment. The presence of overlapping daytime symptoms between insomnia and other mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> may influence health professionals’ decisions to provide or refer for psychological treatment. It is plausible that sleep difficulties are often perceived consequently or secondary to underlying mental health issues.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Therefore, the perception and interpretation of daytime sleep symptoms by health professionals are crucial in determining assessment and treatment decisions. This aspect requires further exploration beyond the scope of the current cross-sectional study. It is evident that ongoing training and education for health professionals regarding evidence-based treatments for probable insomnia, including CBTi, is necessary. Knowledge and perceptions surrounding the efficacy of psychological treatments for insomnia may be limited.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Improving health professionals’ understanding and awareness of these treatments can help bridge the gap between the prevalence of insomnia and the utilisation of appropriate interventions.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The findings of the current study should be interpreted considering several limitations. Firstly, the data collected in this study relied on self-report measures, which may introduce potential biases. Research has shown that individuals may not always accurately estimate variables related to sleep, such as sleep latency and duration.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Additionally, the accuracy of recall regarding health utilisation can be influenced by factors, such as the design of the questionnaire</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> and the length of the recall period.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Secondly, the study assessed variables related to an ever-diagnosed mental health condition, sleep symptoms over the past month, and sleep discussions and treatment over the past 12 months. The use of different time periods for different variables may introduce some inconsistency in the data and limit the ability to draw causal conclusions. Such time frames may account for notable proportion of participants without probable insomnia who reported discussing sleep and receiving treatment in the last 12 months, as sleep issues may have been resolved at the time of completing the survey. Thirdly, it is important to acknowledge that the survey was conducted online, which may have resulted in the underrepresentation of individuals who have limited internet access, such as those from remote areas</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> or with severe and chronic mental health symptoms.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Fourthly, it is important to note that this study did not consider other conditions that could potentially affect sleep, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> or sleep apnea.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> The focus of this study was specifically on mental health conditions and probable insomnia. Exploring the associations between probable insomnia and other medical conditions like COPD or sleep apnea was beyond the scope of this research. However, future studies should consider investigating the impact of comorbid conditions on sleep and treatment utilisation in individuals with mental health conditions, probable insomnia, and individuals not meeting criteria for probable insomnia. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing sleep care provision in this population. Fifthly, it is important to consider the possibility of misreporting when participants indicated receiving cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) instead of CBT for insomnia (CBTi). Both CBT and CBTi can include similar therapeutic components, such as cognitive restructuring and relaxation techniques.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> It is possible that some participants may have mistakenly reported receiving CBTi when they received a broader form of CBT that included sleep-related elements. However, it is important to note that CBTi specifically includes additional components such as stimulus control and sleep restriction therapy, which are known to be highly effective in treating insomnia symptoms.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Therefore, the reported percentage of participants who received CBTi from a health professional may be inflated due to potential misclassification. Lastly, it is worth mentioning that the availability of health professionals trained in CBTi can be a potential barrier for consumers seeking first line treatment.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> However, this specific barrier was not included as an option in the survey, and therefore, its impact on treatment access and utilisation was not directly assessed in this study.</citation_analysis></p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">This study highlights that while discussions about sleep with health professionals are relatively common among individuals with a mental health condition, the utilisation of effective sleep treatments, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi), remains low. The findings indicate an unmet need for care, as a significant proportion of individuals with probable insomnia do not receive appropriate treatment. Pharmacological management, such as sleep medication, is more commonly utilized than CBTi, despite CBTi being the recommended first line treatment for insomnia. Cost concerns and the lack of referral for CBTi from general practitioners were reported as barriers to accessing this treatment. It is crucial to raise awareness of the importance of sleep and the benefits of evidence-based treatments, as well as to update clinical guidelines to highlight the need for routine sleep discussions and provide clear referral pathways.</citation_analysis></p>
