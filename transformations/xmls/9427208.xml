          <title>Purpose</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="negative">The aim of this exploratory cross-sectional mixed methods study was to determine 1) whether sleep inertia, the temporary state of impaired vigilance performance upon waking, is perceived to be a concern by emergency service personnel, 2) what strategies are currently used by emergency service workplaces to manage sleep inertia, 3) the barriers to implementing reactive sleep inertia countermeasures, and 4) what strategies personnel suggest to manage sleep inertia.</citation_analysis></p>

          <title>Participants and Methods</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">A sample (n = 92) of employed and volunteer Australian emergency service personnel (fire and rescue, ambulance, police, state-based rescue and recovery personnel) completed an online survey. Data collected included demographic variables and work context, experiences of sleep inertia in the emergency role, barriers to sleep inertia countermeasures, and existing workplace sleep inertia countermeasures and recommendations. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics, and qualitative data were thematically analysed.</citation_analysis></p>

        <sec id="s2003">
          <title>Results</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Approximately 67% of participants expressed concern about sleep inertia when responding in their emergency role. Despite this, there were few strategies to manage sleep inertia in the workplace. One major barrier identified was a lack of time in being able to implement sleep inertia countermeasures. Fatigue management strategies, such as reducing on-call periods, and operational changes, such as screening calls to reduce false alarms, were suggested by participants as potential strategies to manage sleep inertia.</citation_analysis></p>

        <sec id="s2004">
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Sleep inertia is a concern for emergency service personnel and thus more research is required to determine effective sleep inertia management strategies to reduce the risks associated with sleep inertia and improve personnel safety and those in their care. In addition, future studies could investigate strategies to integrate reactive sleep inertia countermeasures into the emergency response procedure.</citation_analysis></p>

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Sleep inertia is a transition state that occurs upon waking in which alertness and cognitive performance are temporarily degraded.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Typically, sleep inertia lasts between 15 and 30 min post waking, however studies have found that performance may not stabilize until 2–3 h post-waking.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Importantly, sleep inertia can impair vital cognitive abilities such as vigilance</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> and decision-making.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> While sleep inertia occurs when waking from most sleep periods, it can be more severe, causing greater performance deficits when waking during the biological night.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Furthermore, both waking from deep sleep slow wave sleep</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> and prior sleep restriction</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> have been associated with a greater magnitude of sleep inertia. Since emergency service personnel can experience abrupt night-time awakenings while on-call or during night shifts, they are more likely to experience severe sleep inertia that could impair their ability to perform their jobs safely and effectively. In addition, given that on-call work is associated with a reduction in sleep quantity even when no calls are received, on-call personnel potentially experience chronic sleep loss which can also increase sleep inertia severity.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17–20</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Furthermore, the period in which sleep inertia is likely to be a risk can overlap with travel to incidents in emergency response, thus impacting the safety of personnel and other road users. In emergency work, it is important that personnel perform optimally and operate safely as small mistakes or lapses in performance and efficiency can have dire consequences for the safety and wellbeing of those involved.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></citation_analysis></p>

In addition, while several experimental studies investigated both proactive and reactive sleep inertia countermeasures, there are few field-based studies exploring how sleep inertia might be best managed under real-world conditions. Reactive countermeasures are typically targeted to on-call personnel; however, it is unknown whether such countermeasures are practical for personnel in operational conditions. Occupational health and safety intervention effectiveness research serves to evaluate the development and implementation of interventions, as well as the success of the intervention.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health put forward a conceptual framework for investigating the effectiveness of occupational safety and health interventions, which involved three broad research phases: development, implementation, and evaluation.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Intervention development is the first phase which seeks to answer questions related to what change is needed, the best practice in addressing these changes, potential barriers in implementing interventions, and whether the intended audience or target population are likely to understand and “buy into” change.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> To answer these questions, data need to be collected to understand the behaviors, attitudes, and knowledge of the target population(s).

      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">To the authors’ knowledge, there has been no systematic investigation into the effectiveness of interventions to manage sleep inertia (ie, sleep inertia countermeasures) at the development phase. As a result, the current exploratory research seeks to begin the development phase of intervention effectiveness research into sleep inertia countermeasures with the target population of emergency service workers. Specifically, this research aims to determine: a) whether sleep inertia is a concern for emergency service personnel, and if yes, to what degree it is a concern, b) what sleep inertia countermeasures are already being used by emergency service organizations—if any, c) the barriers to implementing reactive countermeasures for emergency service personnel, and d) what changes could be made in the workplace to reduce the impact of sleep inertia. Such information could help guide or refine experimental research towards strategies to manage sleep inertia that would be both effective and practical to use in the field by the target population and thus improve worker health and safety when waking and responding to calls.</citation_analysis></p>

Recruitment ran from August to October 2020 and the survey was disseminated through industry and personal contacts, as well as posts on social media (Twitter and Facebook). The first page of the survey provided information about the project, including the benefits and risks of participating, consent, data publication, and contact details for any questions and concerns. Participants were notified that their participation was anonymous and voluntary, and they could withdraw at any point by closing the browser. Prior to beginning the survey, participants were required to provide informed consent on the first page of the survey. The survey took approximately 15–20 minutes to complete, and participants were provided with contact details of the study coordinator if they had questions or wanted to request a plain English summary of results. Ethics approval was obtained from the Central Queensland University Human Research Ethics Committee (project number: 0000022402). The study was conducted in compliance with the ethical principles set out in the Declaration of Helsinki.</citation_analysis></p>

        <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Participants were asked basic demographic questions followed by specific questions about their work context. The demographic questions included: age, gender (male, female, other), and postcode. Work context questions included: “What area of emergency services are you primarily in?” (fire and rescue, ambulance, police, state-based rescue and recovery, or other; with the employment options of salaried, retained, or volunteer); “How long have you been involved in the emergency service field?” (less than 12 months, 1–2 years, 2–5 years, 5–10 years, and more than 10 years); “What types of schedule do you work/volunteer in your primary emergency service role?” (regular day-time schedule, rotating shift work, combination of days/nights and/or evenings, regular day shifts and on-call at other times, regular night shifts and on-call at other times, regular rotating shifts and on-call at other times, only on-call, and other).</citation_analysis></p>

        <title>Experiences of Sleep Inertia in the Emergency Service Role</title>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">This section sought to determine how often participants experience sleep inertia, whether sleep inertia is a concern for them, and if they used any strategies to reduce sleep inertia. Given that sleep inertia is not a commonly used term in the general public, participants were first provided with the following definition of sleep inertia and sleep inertia countermeasures:
</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><disp-quote><p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Sleep inertia is the groggy, sleepy state that you may feel immediately after waking. During sleep inertia you also tend to perform tasks worse than compared to when you’re wide awake. Sleep inertia is worse immediately after waking and gets better over time. It can take 20–30 minutes for sleep inertia to wear off, but full recovery can take up to 2 hours or more. Sleep inertia countermeasures are strategies that can be used to reduce sleep inertia, thus helping you to wake up quicker.</citation_analysis></p></disp-quote></citation_analysis></p>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Using a 5-point Likert scale, participants were asked “how often do you experience sleep inertia when you wake to immediately respond to your emergency service role?” (1 = always, 5 = never). Participants were then asked, “is sleep inertia a concern for you personally?” (yes/no) and “is sleep inertia a concern for you broadly? (eg, in regard to the safety of others)” (yes/no). Participants were then asked to describe why sleep inertia is or is not a concern for them (open response). Finally, participants were asked “do you do anything in particular to help wake yourself up (ie, reduce sleep inertia) when woken to immediately respond for your emergency services role?” (yes/no). If participants selected ‘yes’ they were then asked, “what do you typically do to help wake yourself up (ie, reduce sleep inertia) when woken to respond for your emergency services role?” (open response). Using a 5-point Likert scale, participants were then asked, “How much does your waking procedure described above actually help to wake you up?” (1 = Does not wake me up, 5 = Completely wakes me up.</citation_analysis></p>

Participants were also given the option to select “Other barriers” and were provided with a text box to describe the other potential barriers. If participants chose “This strategy is already formally used in my workplace” they were provided with a text box to describe how this strategy was being used in their workplace. To identify which strategies participants were willing to use, participants were provided with the list of seven countermeasures and asked “Which of these strategies would you actually want to use? Please select ‘yes’ if you would use this strategy or ‘no’ if you would not use this strategy. If you select ‘no’ please briefly explain why you would not use this strategy.” Using the same method, participants were then asked “Which of these strategies do you believe would actually reduce sleep inertia?

        <title>RQ2: What Sleep Inertia Countermeasures are Already Being Used by Emergency Organizations?</title>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">To address this research question, we looked at the frequency of responses of “This strategy is already formally used in my workplace” for each reactive sleep inertia countermeasure in the survey. Three out of the seven sleep inertia countermeasures included in this survey were already being used in the workplace: Exposure to bright light (12% of participants), drinking coffee (4% of participants) and listening to music (2% of participants). When asked how exposure to bright light is used to manage sleep inertia in the workplace, those who indicated that they are on-call from home described turning on lights around the house upon waking. Those who indicated that they are on-call and located at work described bright light being used at the station, operations, and communication rooms. Drinking coffee upon waking was primarily used by on-call participants to manage sleep inertia in the workplace as part of fatigue management policy and was often provided by the workplace. Finally, descriptions of how listening to music is used to manage sleep inertia in the workplace indicated that this strategy was used informally by individuals rather than strategically to manage sleep inertia, for example, workers may play music on the way to a job. For all three countermeasures that were already being used in the workplace, participants rated these strategies, on average, as “somewhat effective” at reducing sleep inertia.</citation_analysis></p>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">This research question was further addressed with the survey question “Does your emergency service workplace or volunteer organization have any management strategies for sleep inertia that have not yet been covered in this survey?” Eight percent of participants indicated that their workplace had strategies to manage sleep inertia outside of those strategies already described in this survey. The strategies reported by participants fell into two categories “formal strategies” and “informal strategies”. Formal strategies included stand down periods if fatigued, extra oversight or supervision, and formal operational fatigue management including limits on shift durations and number of days rostered on and off. Informal strategies included avoiding sleeping, waking to the loud alarm of the pager (the alarm itself was alerting), changing outfits before going to the station, and choosing to sleep on site.</citation_analysis></p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The primary aim of this exploratory study was to determine how sleep inertia is perceived by emergency service personnel and managed by their workplaces, as well as the barriers to implementing reactive sleep inertia countermeasures. Our findings suggest that sleep inertia is a concern for emergency service personnel; however, there are currently few formal strategies to manage sleep inertia implemented in the workplace. This gap in sleep inertia management may be attributed to the practical barriers to undertaking reactive sleep inertia countermeasures for emergency service personnel, with time being a major and unavoidable constraint for this cohort. These results suggest that strategies aimed at eliminating sleep inertia prior to starting work are unlikely to be feasible. Rather, a focus on reducing the magnitude of sleep inertia (eg, fatigue reduction strategies), and/or reducing the potential for errors while experiencing sleep inertia, should be explored for emergency service industries.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Our study found that sleep inertia is experienced by the majority of emergency service personnel, with 77% of participants reporting that they had experienced sleep inertia at some time while undertaking their emergency role. In addition, a third of participants either reported that they experienced sleep inertia “often” or “always” when responding in their emergency role, indicating that sleep inertia is a common experience for many personnel. Approximately two-thirds of participants reported that sleep inertia is a concern for them personally or broadly (ie, in relation to others). Participants’ personal concerns were mainly focused on their ability to perform their role adequately and to drive safely either to the station from their home or to incident sites from the station. Similarly, in other research, firefighters have reported major concerns with driving shortly after waking, particularly in relation to staying alert.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> Participants’ broad concerns also related to their colleagues’ abilities to adequately perform their role and to drive safely. Such concerns regarding performance or driving ability while experiencing sleep inertia are not unfounded since sleep inertia is associated with impairments to various aspects of cognition.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> With regard to driving, a recent study found impairments to lane and speed-keeping abilities soon after waking from sleep.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> One participant in the current study attributed sleep inertia to an incident in which they dispatched an incorrect brigade and expressed concerns about the welfare of those being attended to, had they had not realized their mistake. Such a report clearly illustrates that sleep inertia can have potentially dire consequences in this field of work. Overall, emergency service personnel believe that sleep inertia has the potential to place themselves, their colleagues, other road users, and people that they may be attending to (eg, patients) at risk.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Despite the majority (67%) of participants reporting concerns with sleep inertia, less than 30% of participants reported that their workplace had strategies in place to manage sleep inertia. Approximately 20% of participants reported reactive sleep inertia countermeasures being implemented in their workplace and 8% of participants reported other strategies. Of the reactive sleep inertia countermeasures, bright lights, caffeine, and listening to music were used in some capacity in workplaces. Qualitative findings revealed that bright lights and caffeine were used at an organizational level as part of fatigue management strategies (eg, bright lights in the workplace and coffee available), whereas listening to music appeared to be an informal individual-level strategy (eg, individuals sometimes used the radio in vehicles). It is unknown, however, whether the implementation of these strategies in the workplace is resulting in measurable reductions in sleep inertia in personnel. As such, intervention effectiveness research is needed to determine the actual efficacy of sleep inertia interventions utilised in workplaces under real-world conditions.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">It is possible that the limited use of reactive sleep inertia countermeasures in emergency workplaces could be due to barriers for implementation. Indeed, our findings suggest that emergency service personnel believe there are motivational and practical barriers to implementing reactive sleep inertia countermeasures. With regard to motivational barriers, our results found that for all reactive sleep inertia countermeasure, over half of participants believed that they would be effective in reducing sleep inertia; however, only three countermeasures (exposure to bright light, face washing and listening to music) would be used by more than half of participants. This information is critical as attitudes towards sleep inertia countermeasures could determine whether the countermeasure is implemented. The theory of planned behavior suggests that people will engage in behavior if they believe that the behavior (eg, exposure to bright light) will lead to a valued outcome (eg, will reduce sleep inertia) and/or experience (eg, is convenient/comfortable).</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"> Reasons cited for not wanting to use reactive sleep inertia countermeasures were primarily based on motivation, comfort, and concerns it would impact negatively on others. Our findings suggest that while many participants believed that sleep inertia countermeasures would lead to a valued outcome (ie, reduce sleep inertia), many countermeasures would not necessarily lead to a valued experience (ie, the countermeasure would be uncomfortable or difficult to perform). As such, future research could focus efforts on sleep inertia countermeasures that participants a) believe will work, b) are willing to perform, and c) have some evidence base for reducing sleep inertia (for example, there is no evidence yet that face washing can significantly reduce sleep inertia).</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Participants also perceived several practical barriers to sleep inertia countermeasures. Accessibility of equipment, space, cost, comfort, and workplace support were all considered barriers for all countermeasures to varying extents. However, time was perceived to be the greatest barrier for the majority (six out of seven) of the reactive countermeasures investigated in this study. Given that emergency service work is often time critical, having a limited amount of time to enact reactive sleep inertia countermeasures is an inherent and unavoidable characteristic of the emergency service role. Qualitative responses revealed that time-based concerns were related to how long it might take to undertake a countermeasure, for example, time needed to exercise, and how long it might take for the countermeasure to take effect, for example the onset of an effect of caffeine when chewing caffeinated gum. While reactive sleep inertia countermeasures may take time to complete, it is possible for some countermeasures (exercise, chewing gum, bright light exposure) to be implemented concurrently with other tasks to avoid any loss of time in responding to emergencies. For example, in research conducted by the present authors (currently under review), volunteer firefighters reported that they would incorporate short bursts of exercise to help wake up as part of their response to night-time calls. Specifically, some volunteers reported that they would intentionally run from their houses to their cars to drive to the station, and then they would run from their car to the station to help wake up. Given that our findings suggest that sleep inertia is a concern for emergency service personnel, it would be worthwhile further investigating ways that reactive sleep inertia countermeasures could be tailored and incorporated into the emergency response procedure for different emergency sectors and workplaces so that time is no longer a barrier. In some cases, this may not be possible and so interventions to minimize the severity or associated risks of sleep inertia should be explored, for example, by reducing the factors that lead to severe sleep inertia.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></citation_analysis></p>

Such strategies included stand down periods, limits on shift duration and numbers of days rostered on and off. In addition, fatigue management strategies were often suggested by participants when asked “what could be done in the workplace to manage sleep inertia”. Suggestions included reducing shift lengths, reducing on-call periods, and number of days on-call and screening calls to ensure that sleep is not interrupted by false alarms. While fatigue management strategies could play a role in reducing sleep inertia severity, there are potential financial constraints in doing so, for example, needing to employ more staff to reduce shift lengths or to screen calls for urgency. Such strategies may not be desirable or financially possible for all workplaces.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">For workplaces where changes in shift arrangements (eg, reducing shift lengths, reducing on-call periods) are not feasible, another alternative to consider in managing sleep inertia risk may be operational changes. One example of an operational change suggested by participants was delaying response times for non-urgent calls so that personnel are not responding while experiencing sleep inertia.

      <title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Some limitations of this study should be considered. First, our sample was primarily made up of fire and rescue (69%) and ambulance personnel (21%), with a small percentage of state emergency service personnel (9%) and police officers (1%). It is possible that state emergency sectors and the police force have differing workplace conditions that may mean that our findings are not generalizable to personnel in these industries. Future field-based research on sleep inertia with emergency service personnel should aim for a larger sample with appropriate representation from all emergency industries. A larger sample would also allow for adequate statistical power to further investigate differences in sleep inertia concerns and perceived barriers for sleep inertia countermeasures between demographic variables such as age, schedule, length of service and emergency industry. Second, only Australian emergency service personnel were included in the sample and thus our findings may not generalize to emergency service personnel in other countries. An international sample may provide new insights on how sleep inertia is experienced and managed around the world. Third, while a definition of sleep inertia was provided in the survey to ensure that participants understood the term, this definition, particularly the statement regarding how sleep inertia can result in worse performance may have unintentionally primed participant responses. This could have resulted in an overestimation of participants’ negative experiences and concern about sleep inertia. While some priming may be unavoidable when providing the definition of sleep inertia, future studies could consider moderating the definition of sleep inertia provided to participants to limit any potential influence on responses. This may include adding that in some cases sleep inertia can resolve quickly and that there may be differences in how people experience sleep inertia. Acknowledging that individuals may experience sleep inertia differently may prompt participants to consider their own experiences of sleep inertia more deeply and could improve the validity of their responses. Fourth, this survey was effective in capturing a broad insight into the ways that workplaces manage sleep inertia; however, individuals and workplaces may have strategies to manage sleep inertia that are not recognized as such by personnel. In addition, there are other barriers to interventions that were not explored in depth in this study, such as organizational culture and values towards safety, which could impact the implementation and success of interventions. Future research could use qualitative interviews or focus groups to gain a deeper insight into how emergency workplaces manage sleep inertia, and organizational culture and values towards safety.</citation_analysis></p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Our findings suggest that sleep inertia is a common and concerning experience for emergency service personnel which can affect themselves, their colleagues, bystanders, and individuals that they may be attending to as part of their role. While inherent to the on-call role, sleep inertia is a complicated problem to address in the emergency services sector with time perceived to be the main barrier in implementing reactive sleep inertia countermeasures. Investigations into how reactive sleep inertia countermeasures could be implemented concurrently into the emergency response procedure could help overcome this barrier. Further research into the efficacy of strategies to manage sleep inertia severity (ie, fatigue management strategies) and risk (ie, operational changes such as delaying response time or double-checking procedures) could be conducted and implemented in addition to reactive sleep inertia countermeasures where possible. Given that sleep inertia is a concern for emergency service personnel, it is important to determine effective and feasible strategies to manage or reduce the risk of sleep inertia in emergency sectors to protect the safety of personnel but also the community and individuals they serve.</citation_analysis></p>
