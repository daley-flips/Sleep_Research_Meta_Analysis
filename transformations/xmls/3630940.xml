      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Overnight oximetry is a commonly used case-finding tool in patients with suspected sleep apnea in the UK. In the latter disorder, the oximetry trace typically shows repetitive desaturation associated with fluctuations in pulse rate.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Although sleep apnea is one of the commonest causes of excessive daytime sleepiness, there are many other causes for sleepiness, such as poor sleep hygiene, narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnolence, circadian rhythm disorders, restless legs syndrome with/without periodic limb movements (PLMs), and certain drugs. Moreover, many of these disorders can occur in conjunction with sleep apnea.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">One of the sleep disorders in which repeated arousals result in fragmented sleep is periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD). PLMs can occur as part of restless legs syndrome (RLS) or as an isolated phenomenon. PLMs cause sympathetic activation, which result in fluctuations in heart rate and blood pressure during sleep. The latter may account for the apparent association of PLMs with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease.</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-nss-2-107">1</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">–</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-nss-2-107">3</xref></citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="negative">The occurrence of these fluctuations in pulse rate has not been used to identify PLMs in patients screened with overnight oximetry to date. The present study was undertaken in a group of patients with polysomnographically proven PLMD to assess whether the presence of increased pulse rate variability (PRV) in the overnight oximetry trace was indicative of the occurrence of PLMs.</citation_analysis></p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">In an earlier study undertaken in our unit,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-nss-2-107">4</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="negative"> spectral analysis of the heart rate trace on PSG was performed in 10 normal subjects and 47 patients with various sleep disorders. It was seen that there were distinct changes in the heart rate in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), non-obstructive hypoventilation, and PLMD. The changes in heart rate in patients with PLMD occurred regardless of the presence of EEG arousals. Thus, we postulated that the presence of heart rate variability in the absence of desaturation may be an indicator of non-sleep apnea disorders like PLMD.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">In a subsequent pilot study,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-nss-2-107">5</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> 6 sleepy patients with isolated increased PRV in the oximetry trace were identified. These patients underwent nocturnal polysomnography (nPSG) to look for the underlying sleep disorder as well as the cause for these variations in pulse rate. It was found that all these patients had PLMD.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The present study was undertaken to further demonstrate that isolated PRV on overnight oximetry may indicate the occurrence of PLMs. As interpretation of the oximetry trace was visual, the degree of concurrence amongst 5 independent interpreters in identifying fluctuations in pulse rate suggesting the occurrence of PLMs was also analyzed.</citation_analysis></p>

      <title>Materials and methods</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">This retrospective study was conducted in the Sleep Disorders Unit of a university hospital in London. The study group included consecutive patients with a polysomnographic diagnosis of PLMD who had undergone prior overnight oximetry followed by PSG over a 7-year period. The control group consisted of patients with OSA, as the latter also causes PRV.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Overnight oximetry graphs of the study and control groups were given to 5 interpreters (3 physicians and 2 senior sleep technologists) for independent analysis. Each oximetry study was printed on A4 paper using a scale of 70%–100% for oxygen saturation (SaO</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><sub>2</sub></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">) and 30–120 beats per minute for pulse. The timescale used was the complete recording (usually 6–8 hours). The scorers did not use the electronic record on the computer screen as the number of data points exceeds the number of pixels on the screen. Hence the average data displayed by the software which gave an appearance of smoothed signals was used.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">A 19-inch screen with a graphics card resolution of 1280 × 1024 was used; this meant that each data point displayed on the screen represented an average of 25 samples. To eliminate this ‘data averaging’, it was necessary to view the record in a 20-minute timescale. Since the analytical method relied on pattern recognition, printed records were used.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">The summary graph of the whole night’s recording derived as described above was printed in 2 formats. The first was a conventional graph available as part of the overnight report (</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-nss-2-107">Figure 1A</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">), and the second with a minimum – maximum trace derived from the software in order to visualize PRV in greater detail (</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-nss-2-107">Figure 1B</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">).</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">All interpreters were blinded with respect to the history and polysomnographic diagnosis. They were required to record their observations on the oximetry traces provided in a predesigned form (</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-nss-2-107">Appendix 1</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">) and to give a global impression based on visual analysis as to whether the patient had one of the following: normal oximetry, OSA, PLMD, or OSA with PLMD.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">Prior to interpretation, the scorers underwent a 45 minute group standard-setting session where they were shown examples of PRV and standard criteria for recognizing PRV, and oxygen desaturations were established. If a variation in the pulse rate was associated with desaturation (defined as a 4% drop or more in arterial SaO</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><sub>2</sub></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither"> from baseline), then the arousal was due to a respiratory event. If the variation was not associated with desaturation, it was defined as ‘isolated PRV’. Thus, oximetry could show: (a) oxygen desaturation associated with PRV; (b) episodic, isolated PRV; (c) continuous, isolated PRV; and (d) normal saturation and pulse trace.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="negative">After interpretation of the overnight oximetry, concurrence amongst the interpreters with respect to the following was computed: (a) presence/absence of PRV, and (b) prediction of the occurrence of PLMs based on the oximetry.</citation_analysis></p>

        <title>Explanation for ‘increased PRV’ by visual analysis</title>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="negative">Traditionally, demonstrating increased heart rate variability has been by computer analysis of the R-R interval. This increased heart rate during or after an arousal can also be appreciated visually on an epoch of PSG (</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-nss-2-107">Figure 2A</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">).</citation_analysis></p>
        <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">Overnight oximetry includes oxygen saturation and a pulse trace in compressed format. Hence the arousals appear as an increased ‘density’ of the pulse rate trace on oximetry (</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-nss-2-107">Figure 2B</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">). Furthermore, the baseline PRV for an individual (related to sinus arrhythmia) can be judged from the very beginning of the recording, ie, presumed wake leading on to presumed sleep. If there is an increase in the density and amplitude of the pulse rate pattern, this can reasonably be assumed to represent increased heart rate variability.</citation_analysis></p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">This study illustrates the significance of increased PRV in oximetry studies that would otherwise be reported as normal because of the absence of desaturation. The presence of isolated fluctuations in pulse rate during sleep is indicative of a change in sleep stage or the occurrence of autonomic activation. The latter can occur with arousals due to any cause (spontaneous, respiratory event, or limb movement related) and cardiac arrhythmias.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">PLMs have been shown to be associated with sympathetic activation which results in autonomic arousals. In the literature published to date,</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-nss-2-107">6</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="neither">–</citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="positive"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-nss-2-107">9</xref></citation_analysis><citation_analysis attribute="negative"> the occurrence of sympathetic activation during PLMs has been used to prove an association between RLS/PLMD and the occurrence of cardiovascular disease. In these studies, sympathetic activation was measured by spectral analysis of heart rate variability on the ECG and changes in blood pressure.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">The novelty in our study lies in the fact that the presence of isolated increased PRV on overnight oximetry has thus far not been used as an indicator of the occurrence of PLMs. Hence the utility of oximetry outside the setting of sleep apnea is limited. Although standard oximetry software can analyze the degree of PRV and produce indices such as the number of 6 beat/min rises per hour, there is no published data on normal values for PRV. In this study, we have demonstrated that visual analysis of the overnight oximetry trace may indicate the occurrence of PLMs if the presence of PRV is identified. In addition, there was more than 80% inter-observer concurrence in suspecting PLMD based on visual analysis of the oximetry trace alone, which also correlated with the occurrence of PLMs on PSG.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="positive">One of the drawbacks of the study was its retrospective nature. Although only patients with PLMD were included, the interpreters were blinded with respect to the polysomnographic findings and the final diagnosis. In addition, there was a control group of patients with OSA.</citation_analysis></p>
      <p><citation_analysis attribute="neither">A prospective study in which all sleepy patients with isolated PRV on overnight oximetry tracings are subjected to PSG would be useful to further define the pattern and occurrence of PRV in other non-apnea sleep disorders as well, thus diversifying the utility of overnight oximetry.</citation_analysis></p>
